# What is the Wheel of Creation?

The Wheel of Creation is a third-party setting and rules supplement for the 5th Edition Open Game License. It portrays a world of grassy steppe, oasis cities, towering mountains, icy forests, and caravans which travel across it and to worlds beyond. Players play as *god-hunters*, groups of adventurers who guide, protect, and fuel these caravans for wealth, renown, and the safety and prosperity of the world.

### The Products

The current plan is that there will be three products associated with the first release of the Wheel of Creation.

1. A free PDF which contains caravaning and monster creation rules, a brief introduction to the setting, a subset of additional race, class, and background options, and a handful of pre-written caravan destinations within the Wheel of Creation setting.
2. A paid PDF with additional art, additional race and class options, full item creation rules, and additional setting description and pre-written caravan destinations.
3. A free web companion tool for monster creation, currently in development at [WheelOfCreation.net](https://wheelofcreation.net/), and potentially other web tools as they are developed.

### Rules and Gameplay

The flow of gameplay in the Wheel of Creation assumes a specific structure of Expeditions, each of which are expected to take aobut 4-6 game sessions: 

* Players choose a destination and decide the initial composition of the caravan under their shared protection.
* The GM decides what places and obstacles they will encounter along the way.
* Throughout the Expedition, players use their skills and connections to learn more about what lies ahead and prepare accordingly.
* Among other challenges, the caravan will be faced with monster raids, and the players will need to protect the caravan.
* At times, the caravan will be unable to progress until the seasons turn or the players may decide to halt of their own accord. They can use this time to trade, gather information, craft items, and explore the area in search for specific monsters.
* At the end of the Expedition, the players are rewarded according to how well their caravan fared and what treasures they were able to gather along the way.
* The players choose a new destination.

There are systems for generating monsters randomly (or not) using a system of tags, creating creatures which are fresh for both the players and GM. The players will need to consult with locals and experts, dig through dusty scrolls, and use their skills and magical abilities to determine the capabilities, behaviors, and weaknesses of these monsters in order to defeat them. A system for creating magical items using treasures and parts looted from these monsters will also be provided.

### The Setting

The Wheel is a flat disk floating in a void of shadowy chaos, divided into three rings which turn about an axle. The axle is called **Heaven**, where sits the Celestial Throne. 

The innermost ring is called the **Ring of Earth**, which most closely resembles our own world. The next ring is called the **Ring of Seasons**, where float shifting islands inhabited by alien creatures, most serving one of four Seasonal Courts. Its turning relative to Earth measures out the year. The outer ring is called the **Ring of Stars**, where mind, soul, and body are undivided. Its turning measures out the ages, and there Heaven stations its most trusted champions to repel the **Void**.

Nearly all of the Ring of Earth belongs to one great landmass, and sea travel is limited by brutal storms and malevolent sea serpents. To the far north are the Glistening Walls of Heaven, which sit at the end of a great expanse of ice. At the southern end of the world are the Ephemeral Wastes, an enormous, scorching desert which is dotted with the Ring of Earth's largest gateways to the Ring of Seasons.

#### Human and Other Cultures

There are four human supercultures in the Wheel of Creation. **Talbarans** are primarily nomadic shepherds which inhabit the great steppe at the Ring of Earth's center. **Pravyans** survive as farmers and hunters in the frozen forests of the northeast. **Riyulans** dwell in the mountainous region in the south, divided into a brutal desert, expansive plateau, and an isolated jungle. In the hilly grasslands to the southeast is the **Azadan** Empire, which controls the only land route to the Wastes. Formerly, the Empire of Lei occupied the southwest, now there lies a haunted ruin.

**Elves** are a people displaced, formerly psionic warriors from the Ring of Stars. Their forms are naturally malleable, and they have quickly adapted to life in the Ring of Seasons and Ring of Earth. **Dwarves** are beings blessed by and in service to the elements, who dwell throughout Earth. **Blins**, including goblins and gnomes, are outcasts of the Courts of the Ring of Seasons. **Scaleborn**, including naga and dragonborn, are the descendants of the Scaled Gods, who were first to rule over the Earth. **Velniki** are horned giants renowned for their strength and unwavering faith in Heaven, dwelling in the mountains between Talbara and Prav. **Daevakin**, or tieflings, are the offspring of humans and wicked demons which inhabit the spaces between the Rings, cursed with horns, fangs, and tails and universally distrusted.

#### Monsters

**Fey** are creatures from the Ring of Seasons, many of which serve the Courts of Spring, Summer, Autumn, and Winter. Each has supernatural abilities and alien desires. **Kostlyavtsi** are intelligent undead humans wielding foul sorceries and collectively working towards some unknown purpose. 

**Tuguai** are decaying constructs of terra cotta and stone, animated by clockwork and magic and built to hunt spellcasters. **Daevas** are manifestations of evil which drive mortals to destruction, feeding on their anger, sorrow, hatred, and, ultimately, their souls. **Skaryid** are inhabitants of the Ring of Stars whose minds are their bodies, corrupted by the Void.
