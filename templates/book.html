<strong>God-Hunter</strong> is a <em>Forged in the Dark</em> tabletop role-playing game for a game-master and two to five players. It depicts a group of roving, oathbound warriors defending communities by banishing monsters and tearing down tyrants, supported by a caravan of friends and followers. Empires churn. Otherworldly forces meddle. Hunters die, but their souls carry on.

   <div class="row"><div class="col section-title">The Game</div></div>
   <div class="row"><div class="col section-text"><p><em>God-Hunter</em> is a game about a group of daring characters defending communities against the powerful forces that seek to destroy or exploit them. We play to find out what change these characters enact on the world and what lessons the world imparts on them.</p>
<h2>The Players</h2>
<p>Each player creates a character and works with the other players to create the caravan which their characters lead. Each player strives to bring their character to life as an interesting, daring character who reaches boldly beyond their current safety and means.</p>
<p>The players work together with the Game Master to establish the tone and style of the game by making judgment calls about the mechanics, dice, and consequences of actions. The players take responsibility as co-authors of the game with the GM.</p>
<h2>The Characters</h2>
<p>The characters are <em>god-hunters</em>, chosen champions carrying forth an ancient duty to protect the people of the world of the <em>Wheel</em>. The Wheel is filled with rulers and supernatural entities both kind and malevolent. God-hunters travel from community to community to hunt down those who threaten the Wheel and its people.</p>
<h2>The Caravan</h2>
<p>God-hunters don't travel or work alone. In addition to creating characters, you’ll also create a caravan of friends and followers who support you.</p>
<h2>The Game Master</h2>
<p>The GM establishes the dynamic world around the characters. The GM plays all the non-player characters in the world by giving each one a concrete desire and preferred method of action.</p>
<p>The GM helps organize the conversation of the game so it’s pointed toward the interesting elements of play. The GM isn’t in charge of the story and doesn’t have to plan events ahead of time. They present interesting opportunities to the players, then follow the chain of action and consequences wherever they lead.</p>
<h2>Playing A Session</h2>
<p>A session of <em>God-Hunter</em> is like an episode of a TV show. There are one or two main events, plus maybe some side-story elements, which all fit into an ongoing series. A session of play can last anywhere from two to six hours, depending on the preferences of the group.</p>
<p>During a session, the god-hunters work together to choose a hunt to accomplish, then they make a few dice rolls to jump into the action of the hunt in progress. The PCs take actions, suffer consequences, and finish the operation (succeed or fail). Then they have downtime, during which they recover, pursue side-projects, and address their bonds. After downtime, the players once again look for a new opportunity or create their own goals and pursuits, and we play to find out what happens next.</p>
<p>At the end of the session, award character XP, caravan XP, and deeds.</p></div></div>

   <div class="row"><div class="col section-title">Player Safety</div></div>
   <div class="row"><div class="col section-text"><p>We play RPGs with both friends and strangers, and with either we should promote the well-being of the people at the table over all else. There are times when the players or the GM may feel stressed or unsafe or otherwise may not be enjoying themselves. Use safety tools when playing God-Hunter as additional means and reminders to communicate with each other, and keep in mind that the use of safety tools is not an excuse to push each other's boundaries.</p>
<p>Here are brief introductions on a few to get you started, along with some further reading to find the tools that best suit your group.</p>
<h2>Session Zero and Lines &amp; Veils</h2>
<p>The first time you play God-Hunter, discuss the tone and subjects of the game as a group. Introduce your safety tools. Create <strong>lines &amp; veils</strong>. Choose your <strong>campaign troubles</strong> (see <a aria-controls="content---game_rules---downtime---portents-md----" aria-expanded="false"
class="collapsed" data-toggle="collapse" href="#content---game_rules---downtime---portents-md----" role="button">Portents</a>).</p>
<p><strong>Lines</strong> are hard limits. The subject of a line doesn't show up in the game at all, even in the background or in reference.</p>
<p><strong>Veils</strong> are soft limits. These things can happen "off-screen"; they are spoken about or we "fade to black" when they occur, but we don't depict or roleplay them.</p>
<p>You can adjust your lines &amp; veils as you play.</p>
<h2>The X-Card</h2>
<p>If you're playing in person, mark an index card with an 'X' and place it where everyone can reach it. During play, when someone taps the X-Card (or types an 'X' in chat while playing online) or asks to 'X-Card' something, we skip over or undo whatever's going on right now. No explanation needed. If the person that used the X-Card is comfortable discussing the content after the session, they may bring it up if they like.</p>
<h2>Breaks and Checking In</h2>
<p>After a set amount of time or when someone asks for a break, take one. Ask each other how you're doing regularly, including before and after the session.</p>

<div class="collapse container-fluid main-content no-transition " id="content---game_rules---basics---core-md----">
   <div class="row"><div class="col section-title">The Core System</div></div>
   <div class="row"><div class="col section-text"><h2>Judgment calls</h2>
<p>When you play, you'll make several key judgment calls. Everyone contributes, but either the players or the GM gets final say for each:</p>
<ul>
<li>Which actions are reasonable as a solution to a problem? <em>Can this person be convinced? Must we fashion a false key for this lock, or could we wreck the door with a battering ram?</em> The players have final say.</li>
<li>How dangerous and how effective is a given action in this circumstance? <em>How risky is this? Can this person be convinced very little or a whole lot?</em> The GM has final say.</li>
<li>Which consequences are inflicted to manifest the dangers in a given circumstance? <em>Does this fall from the roof break your leg? Do the guards merely become suspicious or do they already have you trapped?</em> The GM has final say.</li>
<li>Does this situation call for a dice roll, and which one? <em>Is your character in position to make an action roll or must they first make a resistance roll to gain initiative?</em> The GM has final say.</li>
<li>Which events in the story match the experience triggers for character and caravan advancement? <em>Did you express your character's beliefs, drives, heritage, or background? You tell us.</em> The players have final say.</li>
</ul>
<h2>Rolling the Dice</h2>
<p><em>God-Hunter</em> uses six-sided dice. You roll several at once and read the <strong>single highest result</strong>.</p>
<ul>
<li>If the highest die is a <strong>6</strong>, it's a <strong>full success</strong>—things go well. If you roll more than one <strong>6</strong>, it's a <strong>critical success</strong>—you gain some additional advantage.</li>
<li>If the highest die is a <strong>4 or 5</strong>, that's a <strong>partial success</strong>—you do what you were trying to do, but there are consequences: trouble, harm, reduced effect, etc.</li>
<li>If the highest die is <strong>1-3</strong>, it's a <strong>bad outcome</strong>. Things go poorly. You probably don't achieve your goal and you suffer complications, too.</li>
</ul>
<p><em>If you ever need to roll but you have zero (or negative) dice, roll two dice and take the single lowest result. You can't roll a <strong>critical</strong> when you have zero dice.</em></p>
<p>All the dice systems in the game are expressions of this basic format. When you're first learning the game, you can always “collapse” back down to a simple roll to judge how things go. Look up the exact rule later when you have time.</p>
<p>To create a dice pool for a roll, you'll use a <strong>trait</strong> (like your <span class="game-term">Survey</span> or your <span class="game-term">Prowess</span> or your crew's Tier) and take dice equal to its <strong>rating</strong>. You'll usually end up with one to four dice. Even one die is pretty good in this game—a 50% chance of success. The most common traits you'll use are the <strong>action ratings</strong> of the player characters. A player might roll dice for their <span class="game-term">Clash</span> action rating when they fight an enemy, for example.</p>
<p>There are four types of rolls that you'll use most often in the game:</p>
<ul>
<li><span class="game-term">Action roll. </span>When a PC attempts an action that's dangerous or troublesome, you make an action roll to find out how it goes. Action rolls and their effects and consequences drive most of the game.</li>
<li><span class="game-term">Downtime roll. </span>When the PCs are at their leisure after a job, they can perform downtime activities in relative safety. You make downtime rolls to see how much they get done.</li>
<li><span class="game-term">Fortune roll. </span>The GM can make a fortune roll to disclaim decision making and leave something up to chance. <em>How loyal is an NPC? How much does the plague spread? How much of the ritual is complete before it is interrupted?</em></li>
<li><span class="game-term">Resistance roll. </span>A player can make a resistance roll when their character suffers a consequence they don't like. The roll tells us how much spirit their character spends to reduce the severity of a consequence. <em>When you resist that “Broken Leg” harm, you spend some spirit and now it's only a “Sprained Ankle” instead.</em></li>
</ul>
<h2>The Game Structure</h2>
<p><em>God-Hunter</em> has a structure to play, with four parts. By default, the game is in <strong>free play</strong>—characters talk to each other, they travel, they do things, they make rolls as needed.</p>
<p>When the group is ready, they choose a <em>target</em> for their next hunt, then choose a type of <em>plan</em> to employ. This triggers the <em>engagement roll</em> (which establishes the situation as the operation starts) and then the game shifts into the <strong>hunt</strong> phase.</p>
<p>During the hunt, the PCs engage the target—they make rolls, overcome obstacles, call for flashbacks, and complete the operation (successfully or not). When the score is finished, the game shifts into the <strong>downtime</strong> phase.</p>
<p>During the downtime phase, the GM engages the systems for <em>payoff</em>, and <em>portents</em>, to determine all the fallout from the hunt. Then the PCs each get their <em>downtime activities</em>, such as addressing their bond to restore spirit or working on a long-term project. When all the downtime activities are complete, the game returns to <strong>free play</strong> and the cycle starts over again.</p>
<p>The phases are a conceptual model to help you organize the game. They're not meant to be rigid structures that restrict your options. Think of the phases as a menu of options to fit whatever it is you're trying to accomplish in play. Each phase suits a different goal.</p></div></div>

<div class="collapse container-fluid main-content no-transition " id="content---game_rules---basics---actions-md----">
   <div class="row"><div class="col section-title">Actions & Attributes</div></div>
   <div class="row"><div class="col section-text"><h2>Action Ratings</h2>
<p>There are 12 <strong>actions</strong> in the game that the player characters use to overcome obstacles.</p>
<ul>
<li>Gallop</li>
<li>Prowl</li>
<li>Clash</li>
<li>Wreck</li>
<li>Hunt</li>
<li>Survey</li>
<li>Calculate</li>
<li>Fashion</li>
<li>Commune</li>
<li>Command</li>
<li>Consort</li>
<li>Convince</li>
</ul>
<p>Each action has a <strong>rating</strong> (from zero to 4) that tells you how many dice to roll when you perform that action. Action ratings don’t just represent skill or training—you’re free to describe <em>how</em> your character performs that action based on the type of person they are. Maybe your character is good at <span class="game-term">Command</span> because they have a scary stillness to them, while another character bellows orders and inspires people with their own military prowess.</p>
<p>You choose which action to perform to overcome an obstacle, by describing what your character does. Actions that are poorly suited to the situation may be less effective and may put the character in more danger, but they can still be attempted. Usually, when you perform an action, you’ll make an <strong>action roll</strong> to see how it turns out.</p>
<h2>Action Roll</h2>
<p>You make an <strong>action roll</strong> when your character does something potentially dangerous or troublesome. The possible results of the action roll depend on your character’s <strong>position</strong>. There are three positions: <strong>controlled</strong>, <strong>risky</strong>, and <strong>desperate</strong>. If you’re in a <strong>controlled</strong> position, the possible consequences are less serious. If you’re in a <strong>desperate</strong> position, the consequences can be severe. If you’re somewhere in between, it’s <strong>risky</strong>—usually considered the “default” position for most actions.</p>
<p>If there’s no danger or trouble at hand, you don’t make an action roll. You might make a <strong>fortune</strong> roll or a <strong>downtime</strong> roll or the GM will simply say yes—and you accomplish your goal.</p>
<h2>Attribute Ratings</h2>
<p>There are three <strong>attributes</strong> in the game system that the player characters use to resist bad consequences: <span class="game-term">Insight</span>, <span class="game-term">Prowess</span>, and <span class="game-term">Resolve</span>. Each attribute has a rating (from zero to 4) that tells you how many dice to roll when you use that attribute.</p>
<p>The rating for each attribute is equal to the number of dots in the <strong>first column</strong> under that attribute. The more well-rounded your character is with a particular set of actions, the better their attribute rating.</p>
<h2>Resistance Roll</h2>
<p>Each attribute resists a different type of danger. If you get stabbed, for example, you resist physical harm with your <span class="game-term">Prowess</span> rating. Resistance rolls always succeed—you diminish or deflect the bad result—but the better your roll, the less <strong>spirit</strong> it costs to reduce or avoid the danger.</p>
<p>When the enemy has a big advantage, you’ll need to make a resistance roll before you can take your own action. For example, when you duel the master sword-fighter, she disarms you before you can strike. You need to make a resistance roll to keep hold of your blade if you want to attack her. Or perhaps you face a powerful daeva and attempt to <span class="game-term">Commune</span> with it to restrain its energies. But before you can make your own roll, you must resist possession from the spirit.</p>
<p>The GM judges the threat level of the enemies and uses these “preemptive” resistance rolls as needed to reflect the capabilities of especially dangerous foes.</p>
<p>For details on <strong>Resistance Rolls</strong>, see page 28.</p>
<h2>Actions</h2>
<p>When you <span class="game-term">Commune</span>, you open your mind to powers and entities unseen.</p>
<p><em>You might communicate with a ghost. You could try to perceive beyond sight in order to better understand your situation (but Surveying might be better).</em></p>
<p>When you <span class="game-term">Command</span>, you compel swift obedience.</p>
<p><em>You might intimidate or threaten to get what you want. You might lead a crew in a group action. You could try to order people around to persuade them (but Consorting might be better).</em></p>
<p>When you <span class="game-term">Consort</span>, you socialize with friends and contacts.</p>
<p><em>You might gain access to resources, information, people, or places. You might make a good impression or win someone over with your charm and style. You might make new friends or connect with your heritage or background. You could try to manipulate your friends with social pressure (but Convince might be better).</em></p>
<p>When you <span class="game-term">Gallop</span>, you move with speed, power, and grace.</p>
<p><em>You might race across rooftops or scramble up a wall. You might charge an opponent head on, spear out. You might swim for a river bank while being rushed towards a waterfall. You might duck in and out of battle, loosing shafts all the while. You could try to move too quickly for a patrol to notice you (but Prowl might be better).</em></p>
<p>When you <span class="game-term">Hunt</span>, you carefully track a target.</p>
<p><em>You might follow a target or discover their location. You might arrange an ambush. You might attack with precision shooting from a distance. You could try to bring a bow to bear in a melee (but Clashing might be better).</em></p>
<p>When you <span class="game-term">Prowl</span>, you traverse skillfully and quietly.</p>
<p><em>You might sneak past a guard or hide in the shadows. You might blend in with a crowd. You might attack from hiding with a back-stab. You could try to waylay a victim in the midst of battle (but Clashing might be better).</em></p>
<p>When you <span class="game-term">Clash</span>, you entangle a target in close combat so they can’t easily escape.</p>
<p><em>You might brawl or wrestle with them. You might hack and slash. You might seize or hold a position in battle. You could try to fight your way through enemy lines (but Galloping might be better).</em></p>
<p>When you <span class="game-term">Calculate</span>, you interpret the past or predict the future.</p>
<p><em>You might deduce a dead creature's manner of death from its wounds and position. You might determine the proper components to create a spell, alchemical, or machine. You might predict what a faction's next move will be. You could try to work out the angle for a long distance shot (but Hunting might be better).</em></p>
<p>When you <span class="game-term">Survey</span>, you examine something for clues, opportunities, or signs of trouble.</p>
<p><em>You might scan the horizon for approaching danger. You might look for an opponent's weak points. You might closely observe a person's speech or writing to detect lies and true feelings. You could try to (but might be better).</em></p>
<p>When you <span class="game-term">Convince</span>, you influence with guile, charm, or argument.</p>
<p><em>You might lie convincingly. You might persuade someone to do what you want. You might argue a compelling case that leaves no clear rebuttal. You could try to trick people into affection or obedience (but Consorting or Commanding might be better).</em></p>
<p>When you <span class="game-term">Fashion</span>, you build, make, or modify structures, items, or mechanisms.</p>
<p><em>You might repair a spark-craft machine or restore the walls of a fortress. You might set up a trebuchet or ballista. You might rig a trap with a bomb and tripwire or a spiked pit. You could try to rig explosives to bring down a bridge (but Wrecking might be better).</em></p>
<p>When you <span class="game-term">Wreck</span>, you unleash savage force.</p>
<p><em>You might smash down a door or wall with a sledgehammer, or use an explosive to do the same. You might employ chaos or sabotage to create a distraction or overcome an obstacle. You could try to overwhelm an enemy with sheer force in battle (but Clashing might be better).</em></p>
<p>As you can see, many actions overlap with others. This is by design. As a player, you get to choose which action you roll, by saying what your character does. Can you try to <span class="game-term">Wreck</span> someone during a fight? Sure! The GM tells you the position and effect level of your action in this circumstance. As it says, <span class="game-term">Clash</span> <em>might</em> be better (less risky or more effective), depending on the situation at hand (sometimes it won’t be better).</p></div></div>

<div class="collapse container-fluid main-content no-transition " id="content---game_rules---basics---spirit-md----">
   <div class="row"><div class="col section-title">Spirit</div></div>
   <div class="row"><div class="col section-text"><p>Player characters in <em>God-Hunter</em> have a special reserve called <strong>spirit</strong>. When they suffer a consequence that they don’t want to accept, they can spend spirit instead. The result of the <strong>resistance roll</strong> determines how much spirit it costs to avoid a bad outcome.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>During a sword fight, Keith’s character, Cronan, gets stabbed in the chest. Keith rolls his <span class="game-term">Prowess</span> rating to resist, and gets a <span class="game-term">2</span>. It costs 6 spirit minus 2 (the result of the resistance roll) to resist the consequences. Keith marks off 4 spirit and describes how Cronan survives.</p>
<p>The GM rules that the harm is reduced by the resistance roll, but not avoided entirely. Cronan suffers level 2 harm (“Chest Wound”) instead of level 3 harm (“Punctured Lung”).</p>
</blockquote>
<h2>Pushing Yourself</h2>
<p>You can use spirit to push yourself for greater performance. For each bonus you choose below, spend <strong>2 spirit</strong> (each can be chosen once for a given action):</p>
<ul>
<li>Add <strong>+1d</strong> to your roll. (This may be used for an action roll or downtime roll or any other kind of roll where extra effort would help you)</li>
<li>Add <strong>+1 level</strong> to your effect.</li>
<li>Take action when you’re incapacitated.</li>
</ul>
<h2>Running Out of Spirit</h2>
<p>When a PC marks their last spirit box, they've stretched themselves beyond their limits, and they die at the next plausible opportunity. The GM decides when, player describes how. You can't heal, spend spirit, or gain spirit until you die.</p>

<div class="collapse container-fluid main-content no-transition " id="content---game_rules---basics---clocks-md----">
   <div class="row"><div class="col section-title">Progress Clocks</div></div>
   <div class="row"><div class="col section-text"><p>A <strong>progress clock</strong> is a circle divided into segments (see examples at right). Draw a progress clock when you need to track ongoing effort against an obstacle or the approach of impending trouble.</p>
<!--TODO add clock illustration-->

<p><em>Sneaking into the constable's watch tower? Make a clock to track the alert level of the patrolling guards. When the PCs suffer consequences from partial successes or missed rolls, fill in segments on the clock until the alarm is raised.</em></p>
<p>Generally, the more complex the problem, the more segments in the progress clock.</p>
<p>A complex obstacle is a 4-segment clock. A more complicated obstacle is a 6-clock. A daunting obstacle is an 8-segment clock.</p>
<p>When you create a clock, make it about the <strong>obstacle,</strong> not the method. The clocks for an infiltration should be “Interior Patrols” and “The Tower,” not “Sneak Past the Guards” or “Climb the Tower.” The patrols and the tower are the obstacles—the PCs can attempt to overcome them in a variety of ways.</p>
<p>Complex enemy threats can be broken into several “layers,” each with its own progress clock. For example, the daeva cult’s HQ might have a “Perimeter Security” clock, an “Interior Guards” clock, and an “Arcane Wards” clock. The hunters would have to make their way through all three layers to reach the summoning chambers.</p>
<p>Remember that a clock tracks progress. It reflects the fictional situation, so the group can gauge how they’re doing. A clock is like a speedometer in a car. It <em>shows</em> the speed of the vehicle—it doesn’t determine the speed.</p>
<h2>Simple Obstacles</h2>
<p>Not every situation and obstacle requires a clock. Use clocks when a situation is complex or layered and you need to track something over time—otherwise, resolve the result of an action with a single roll.</p>
<p>Examples of progress clocks follow.</p>
<h2>Danger Clocks</h2>
<p>The GM can use a clock to represent a progressive danger, like suspicion growing during a seduction, the proximity of pursuers in a chase, or the alert level of guards on patrol. In this case, when a complication occurs, the GM ticks one, two, or three segments on the clock, depending on the consequence level. When the clock is full, the danger comes to fruition—the guards hunt down the intruders, activate an alarm, release the hounds, etc.</p>
<h2>Racing Clocks</h2>
<p>Create two opposed clocks to represent a race. The PCs might have a progress clock called “Escape” while the monsters have a clock called “Cornered.” If the PCs finish their clock before the monsters fill theirs, they get away. Otherwise, they’re cornered and can’t flee. If both complete at the same time, the PCs make it through the door, but the beasts are just outside!</p>
<p>You can also use racing clocks for an environmental hazard. Maybe the PCs are trying to complete the “Search” clock to find the lockbox on the sinking ship before the GM fills the “Sunk” clock and the vessel goes down.</p>
<h2>Linked Clocks</h2>
<p>You can make a clock that unlocks another clock once it’s filled. For example, the GM might make a linked clock called “Trapped” after an “Alert” clock fills up. When you fight a veteran warrior, she might have a clock for her “Defense” and then a linked clock for “Vulnerable.” Once you overcome the “Defense” clock, then you can attempt to overcome the “Vulnerable” clock and defeat her.  You might affect the “Defense” clock with violence in a knife-fight, or you lower her defense with deception if you have the opportunity. As always, the method of action is up to the players and the details of the fiction at hand.</p>
<h2>Mission Clocks</h2>
<p>The GM can make a clock for a time-sensitive mission, to represent the window of opportunity you have to complete it. If the countdown runs out, the mission is scrubbed or changes—the target escapes, the monster kills again, etc.</p>
<h2>Tug-of-war Clocks</h2>
<p>You can make a clock that can be filled <em>and</em> emptied by events, to represent a back-and-forth situation. You might make a “Revolution!” clock that indicates when the refugees start to riot over poor treatment. Some events will tick the clock up and some will tick it down. Once it fills, the revolution begins.</p>
<h2>Long-term Project</h2>
<p>Some projects will take a long time. A basic long-term project (like tinkering up a new feature for a device) is eight segments. Truly long-term projects (like creating a new designer drug) can be two, three, or even four clocks, representing all the phases of development, testing, and final completion. Add or subtract clocks depending on the details of the situation and complexity of the project.</p>
<p>A long-term project is a good catch-all for dealing with any unusual player goal, including things that circumvent or change elements of the mechanics or the setting.</p>
<h2>Faction Clocks</h2>
<p>Each faction has a long-term goal. When the PCs have <strong>downtime</strong>, the GM ticks forward the faction clocks that they’re interested in. In this way, the world around the PCs is dynamic and things happen that they’re not directly connected to, changing the overall situation in the city and creating new opportunities and challenges.</p>
<p>The PCs may also directly affect NPC faction clocks, based on the missions and hunts they pull off. Discuss known faction projects that they might aid or interfere with, and also consider how a PC operation might affect the NPC clocks, whether the players intended it or not.</p></div></div>
</div>



<div class="collapse container-fluid main-content no-transition " id="content---game_rules---basics---action_roll-md----">
   <div class="row"><div class="col section-title">Action Roll</div></div>
   <div class="row"><div class="col section-text"><p>When a player character does something challenging, we make an <strong>action roll</strong> to see how it turns out. An action is challenging if there’s an obstacle to the PC’s goal that’s dangerous or troublesome in some way. We don’t make an action roll unless the PC is put to the test. If their action is something that we’d expect them to simply accomplish, then we don’t make an action roll.</p>
<p><em>Each game group will have their own ideas about what “challenging” means. This is good! It’s something that establishes the tone and style of your God-Hunter series.</em></p>
<p>To make an action roll, we go through six steps. In play, they flow together somewhat, but let’s break each one down here for clarity.</p>
<ul>
<li>The player states their <strong>goal</strong> for the action.</li>
<li>The player chooses the <strong>action rating</strong>.</li>
<li>The GM sets the <strong>position</strong> for the roll.</li>
<li>The GM sets the <strong>effect level</strong> for the action.</li>
<li>Add <strong>bonus dice</strong>.</li>
<li>The player rolls the dice and we judge the result.</li>
</ul>
<h2>1. The Player States Their Goal</h2>
<p>Your goal is the concrete outcome your character will achieve when they overcome the obstacle at hand. Usually the character’s goal is pretty obvious in context, but it’s the GM’s job to ask and clarify the goal when necessary.</p>
<p><em>“You’re punching him in the face, right? Okay... what do want to get out of this? Do you want to take him out, or just rough him up so he’ll do what you want?”</em></p>
<h2>2. The Player Chooses the Action Rating</h2>
<p>The player chooses which <strong>action rating</strong> to roll, following from what their character is doing on-screen. If you want to roll your <span class="game-term">Clash</span> action, then get in a fight. If you want to roll your <span class="game-term">Command</span> action, then order someone around. You can’t roll a given action rating unless your character is presently performing that action in the fiction.</p>
<h2>3. The GM Sets the Position</h2>
<p>Once the player chooses their action, the GM sets the <strong>position</strong> for the roll. The position represents how dangerous or troublesome the action might be. There are three positions: <strong>controlled</strong>, <strong>risky</strong>, and <strong>desperate</strong>. To choose a position, the GM looks at the profiles for the positions below and picks one that most closely matches the situation at hand.</p>
<p><strong>By default, an action roll is risky.</strong> You wouldn’t be rolling if there was no risk involved. If the situation seems more dangerous, make it desperate. If it seems less dangerous, make it controlled.</p>
<h2>4. The GM Sets the Effect Level</h2>
<p>The GM assesses the likely <strong>effect level</strong> of this action, given the factors of the situation. Essentially, the effect level tells us “how much” this action can accomplish: will it have <strong>limited</strong>, <strong>standard</strong>, or <strong>great</strong> effect?</p>
<p><em>The GM’s choices for effect level and position can be strongly influenced by the player’s choice of action rating. If a player wants to try to make a new friend by <span class="game-term">Wrecking</span> something—well... maybe that’s possible, but the GM wouldn’t be crazy to say it’s a desperate roll and probably limited effect. Seems like <span class="game-term">Consorting</span> would be a lot better for that. The players are always free to choose the action they perform, but that doesn’t mean all actions should be equally risky or potent.</em></p>
<h2>5. Add Bonus Dice</h2>
<p>You can normally get two bonus dice for your action roll (some special abilities might give you additional bonus dice).</p>
<p>For one bonus die, you can get <strong>assistance</strong> from a teammate. They spend 1 spirit, say how they help you, and give you +1d.</p>
<p>For another bonus die, you can either <strong>push yourself</strong> (spend 2 spirit) or you can accept a <strong>Divine Bargain</strong> (you can’t get dice for both, it’s one or the other).</p>
<h3>The Divine Bargain</h3>
<p>PCs in <em>God-Hunter</em> can struggle against fate, but there is always a karmic cost. To reflect this, the GM or any other player can offer you a bonus die if you accept a Divine Bargain. Common Divine Bargains include:</p>
<ul>
<li>Collateral damage, unintended harm.</li>
<li>Sacrifice <span class="game-term">dragonsilk</span> or an item.</li>
<li>Offend or anger a faction.</li>
<li>Start and/or tick a troublesome clock.</li>
<li>Advance a portent.</li>
<li>Suffer harm.</li>
</ul>
<p>The Divine Bargain occurs regardless of the outcome of the roll. You make the deal, pay the price, and get the bonus die.</p>
<p>The Divine Bargain is always a free choice. If you don’t like one, just reject it (or suggest how to alter it so you might consider taking it). You can always just push yourself for that bonus die instead.</p>
<p>If it’s ever needed, the GM has final say over which Divine Bargains are valid.</p>
<h2>6. Roll the Dice and Judge the Result</h2>
<p>Once the goal, action rating, position, and effect have been established, add any bonus dice and roll the dice pool to determine the outcome. (See the sets of possible outcomes, by position, on the next page.)</p>
<p>The action roll does a lot of work for you. It tells you how well the character performs as well as how serious the consequences are for them. They might succeed at their action without any consequences (on a <span class="game-term">6</span>), or they might succeed but suffer consequences (on a <span class="game-term">4/5</span>), or it might just all go wrong (on a <span class="game-term">1-3</span>).</p>
<p>On a <span class="game-term">1-3</span>, it’s up to the GM to decide if the PC’s action has any effect or not, or if it even happens at all. Usually, the action just fails completely, but in some circumstances, it might make sense or be more interesting for the action to have some effect even on a <span class="game-term">1-3</span> result.</p>
<p>Each <span class="game-term">4/5</span> and <span class="game-term">1-3</span> outcome lists suggested <strong>consequences</strong> for the character. The worse your position, the worse the consequences are. The GM can inflict one or more of these consequences, depending on the circumstances of the action roll. PCs have the ability to avoid or reduce the severity of consequences that they suffer by <strong>resisting</strong> them.</p>
<p>When you narrate the action after the roll, the GM and player collaborate together to say what happens on-screen. <em>Tell us how you vault across to the other rooftop. Tell us what you say to the governor to convince her. The GM will tell us how she reacts. When you face the Mirror Clan champion one-on-one, what’s your fighting style like? Etc.</em></p>
<h2>Action Roll Summary</h2>
<ul>
<li>A player or GM calls for a roll. Make an <strong>action roll</strong> when the character performs a dangerous or troublesome action.</li>
<li>The player chooses the <strong>action rating</strong> to roll. Choose the action that matches what the character is doing in the fiction.</li>
<li>The GM establishes the <strong>position</strong> and <strong>effect level</strong> of the action. The choice of position and effect is influenced strongly by the player’s choice of action.</li>
<li>Add up to two bonus dice. 1) <strong>Assistance</strong> from a teammate (they spend 1 spirit). 2) <strong>Push yourself</strong> (you spend 1 spirit) or accept a <strong>Divine Bargain</strong>.</li>
<li>Roll the dice pool and judge the outcome. The players and GM narrate the action together. The GM has final say over what happens and inflicts consequences as called for by the position and the result of the roll.</li>
</ul>
<h2>Double-duty Rolls</h2>
<p>Since NPCs don’t roll for their actions, an action roll does double-duty: <strong>it resolves the action of the PC as well as any NPCs that are involved</strong>. The single roll tells us how those actions interact and which consequences result. On a <span class="game-term">6</span>, the PC wins and has their effect. On a <span class="game-term">4/5</span>, it’s a mix—both the PC and the NPC have their effect. On a <span class="game-term">1-3</span>, the NPC wins and has their effect as a consequence on the PC.</p>
<!--@TODO add Action Roll table p21--></div></div>
</div>



<div class="collapse container-fluid main-content no-transition " id="content---game_rules---basics---effect-md----">
   <div class="row"><div class="col section-title">Effect</div></div>
   <div class="row"><div class="col section-text"><p>In <em>God-Hunter</em>, you achieve goals by taking actions and facing consequences. But how many actions does it take to achieve a particular goal? That depends on the <strong>effect level</strong> of your actions. The GM judges the effect level using the profiles below. Which one best matches the action at hand—<strong>great</strong>, <strong>standard</strong>, or <strong>limited</strong>? Each effect level indicates the questions that should be answered for that effect, as well as how many segments to tick if you’re using a <strong>progress clock</strong>.</p>
<!--@TODO add fancy effect levels p23.-->

<h2>Assessing Factors</h2>
<p>To assess effect level, first start with your gut feeling, given this situation. Then, if needed, assess three factors that may modify the effect level: <strong>potency</strong>, <strong>scale</strong>, and <strong>quality</strong>. If the PC has an advantage in a given factor, consider a higher effect level. If they have a disadvantage, consider a reduced effect level.</p>
<h3>Potency</h3>
<p>The potency factor considers particular weaknesses, taking extra time or a bigger risk, or the influence of arcane powers. An infiltrator is more potent if all the lights are extinguished and they move about in the dark.</p>
<h3>Quality/Tier</h3>
<p>Quality represents the effectiveness of tools, weapons, or other resources, usually summarized by Tier. <strong>Fine items</strong> count as +1 bonus in quality, stacking with Tier.</p>
<p><em>Setarah is picking the lock to a safehouse run of a gang reknowned for Occult dealings. Her caravan is Tier I and she has fine lockpicks—so she’s effectively Tier II. The Occult gang is Tier III. Setarah is outclassed in quality, so her effect will be limited on the lock.</em></p>
<h3>Scale</h3>
<p>Scale represents the number of opponents, size of an area covered, scope of influence, etc. Larger scale can be an advantage or disadvantage depending on the situation. In battle, more people are better. When infiltrating, more people are a hindrance.</p>
<p>When considering factors, effect level might be reduced below limited, resulting in <strong>zero effect</strong>—or increased beyond great, resulting in an <strong>extreme effect</strong>.</p>
<p>If a PC special ability gives “+1 effect,” it comes into play <em>after</em> the GM has assessed the effect level. For example, if you ended up with zero effect, the +1 effect bonus from your Baghatur’s <span class="game-term">Bodyguard</span> ability would bump them up to limited effect.</p>
<p>Also, remember that a PC can <strong>push themselves</strong> (spend 2 spirit) to get +1 effect on their action.</p>
<p>Every factor won’t always apply to every situation. You don’t have to do an exact accounting every time, either. Use the factors to help you make a stronger judgment call—don’t feel beholden to them.</p>
<h2>Trading Position for Effect</h2>
<p>After factors are considered and the GM has announced the effect level, a player might want to trade position for effect, or vice versa. For instance, if they’re going to make a risky roll with standard effect (the most common scenario, generally), they might instead want to push their luck and make a desperate roll but with great effect.</p>
<p>This kind of trade-off isn’t included in the effect factors because it’s not an element the GM should assess when setting the effect level. Once the level is set, though, you can always offer the trade-off to the player if it makes sense in the situation.</p>
<p><em>“I Prowl across the courtyard and vault over the wall, hiding in the shadows of the outer gardens.”</em></p>
<p><em>“I don’t think you can make it across in one quick dash. The scale of the courtyard is a factor here, so your effect will be limited. Let’s say you can get halfway across with this action, then you’ll have to Prowl through the other half of the space (and the rest of the guards there) to reach the other side.”</em></p>
<p><em>“I didn’t realize it was that far. Hmmm. Okay, what if I just go as fast as I can. Can I get all the way across if I make a desperate roll?”</em></p>
<p><em>“Yep, sounds good to me!”</em></p>
<h2>Consequences</h2>
<p>When a PC suffers an effect from an enemy or a dangerous situation, it’s called a <strong>consequence</strong>. Consequences are the companion to effects. PCs have effect on the world around them and they suffer consequences in return from the risks they face.</p></div></div>

<p>The GM sets position and effect for an action roll at the same time, after the player says what they’re doing and chooses their action. Usually, <strong>Risky / Standard</strong> is the default combination, modified by the action being used, the strength of the opposition, and the effect factors.</p>
<p>The ability to set position and effect as independent variables gives you nine combinations to choose from, to help you convey a wide array of fictional circumstances.</p>
<p><em>For example, if a character is facing off alone against a small enemy gang, the situation might be:</em></p>
<ul>
<li><em>She fights the gang straight up, rushing into their midst, hacking away in a wild </em><span class="game-term">Skirmish</span><em>. In this case, being threatened by the larger force lowers her position to indicate greater risk, and the scale of the gang reduces her effect (Desperate / Limited).</em></li>
<li><em>She fights the gang from a choke-point, like a narrow alleyway where their numbers can’t overwhelm her at once. She’s not threatened by several at once, so her risk is similar to a one-on-one fight, but there’s still a lot of enemies to deal with, so her effect is reduced (Risky / Limited).</em></li>
<li><em>She doesn’t fight the gang, instead trying to maneuver her way past them and escape. She’s still under threat from many enemy attacks, so her position is worse, but if the ground is open and the gang can’t easily corral her, then her effect for escaping isn’t reduced (Desperate / Standard). If she had some immediate means of escape (like leaping onto a speeding carriage), then her effect might even be increased (Desperate / Great).</em></li>
<li><em>The gang isn’t aware of her yet—she’s set up in a sniper position on a nearby roof. She takes a shot against one of them. Their greater numbers aren’t a factor, so her effect isn’t reduced, and she’s not immediately in any danger (Controlled / Great). Maybe instead she wants to fire off a salvo of suppressing fire against the whole gang, in which case their scale applies (Controlled / Limited). If the gang is on guard for potential trouble, her position is more dangerous (Risky / Great). If the gang is alerted to a sniper, then the effect may be reduced further, as they scatter and take cover (Risky / Limited). If the gang is able to muster covering fire while they fall back to a safe position, then things are even worse for our scoundrel (Desperate / Limited).</em></li>

<p>Enemy actions, bad circumstances, or the outcome of a roll can inflict <strong>consequences</strong> on a PC. There are five types (at right).</p>
<p>A given circumstance might result in one or more consequences, depending on the situation. The GM determines the consequences, following from the fiction and the style and tone established by the game group.</p>
<h2>Reduced Effect</h2>
<p>This consequence represents impaired performance. The PC’s action isn’t as effective as they’d anticipated. You hit him, but it’s only a flesh wound. She accepts the forged invitation, but she’ll keep her eye on you throughout the night. You’re able to scale the wall, but it’s slow going—you’re only halfway up. This consequence essentially reduces the effect level of the PC’s action by one after all other factors are accounted for.</p>
<h2>Complication</h2>
<p>This consequence represents trouble, mounting danger, or a new threat. The GM might introduce an immediate problem that results from the action right now: the room catches fire, you’re disarmed, the crew takes +1 <span class="game-term">heat</span> from evidence or witnesses, you lose status with a faction, the target evades you and now it’s a chase, reinforcements arrive, etc.</p>
<p>Or the GM might tick a clock for the complication, instead. Maybe there’s a clock for the alert level of the guards at the manor. Or maybe the GM creates a new clock for the suspicion of the noble guests at the masquerade party and ticks it. Fill one tick on a clock for a minor complication or two ticks for a standard complication.</p>
<p>A <strong>serious complication</strong> is more severe: reinforcements surround and trap you, the room catches fire and falling ceiling beams block the door, your weapon is broken, the crew suffers +2 <span class="game-term">heat</span>, your target escapes out of sight, etc. Fill three ticks on a clock for a serious complication.</p>
<p><strong>Don’t inflict a complication that negates a successful roll.</strong> If a PC tries to corner an enemy and gets a <span class="game-term">4/5</span>, don’t say that the enemy escapes. The player’s roll succeeded, so the enemy is cornered... maybe the PC has to wrestle them into position and during the scuffle the enemy grabs their gun.</p>
<h2>Lost Opportunity</h2>
<p>This consequence represents shifting circumstance. You had an opportunity to achieve your goal with this action, but it slips away. To try again, you need a new approach—usually a new form of action or a change in circumstances. Maybe you tried to <span class="game-term">Skirmish</span> with the noble to trap her on the balcony, but she evades your maneuver and leaps out of reach. If you want to trap her now you’ll have to try another way—maybe by <span class="game-term">Swaying</span> her with your roguish charm.</p>
<h2>Worse Position</h2>
<p>This consequence represents losing control of the situation—the action carries you into a more dangerous position. Perhaps you make the leap across to the next rooftop, only to end up dangling by your fingertips. You haven’t failed, but you haven’t succeeded yet, either. You can try again, re-rolling at the new, worse position. This is a good consequence to choose to show escalating action. A situation might go from controlled, to risky, to desperate as the action plays out and the PC gets deeper and deeper in trouble.</p>
<h2>Harm</h2>
<p>This consequence represents a long-lasting debility (or death). When you suffer harm, record the specific injury on your character sheet equal to the level of harm you suffer. If you suffer <strong>lesser harm</strong>, record it in the bottom row. If you suffer <strong>moderate harm</strong>, write it in the middle row. If you suffer <strong>severe harm</strong>, record it in the top row. See examples of harm and the harm tracker, below.</p>
<p>Your character suffers the penalty indicated at the end of the row if any or all harm recorded in that row applies to the situation at hand. So, if you have “Drained” and “Battered” harm in the bottom row, you’ll suffer reduced effect when you try to run away from the constables. When you’re impaired by harm in the top row (severe harm, level 3), your character is incapacitated and can’t do anything unless you have help from someone else or <strong>push yourself</strong> to perform the action.</p>
<p>If you need to mark a harm level, but the row is already filled, the harm moves up to the next row above. So, if you suffered standard harm (level 2) but had no empty spaces in the second row, you’d have to record severe harm (level 3), instead. If you run out of spaces on the top row and need to mark harm there, your character suffers a <strong>catastrophic, permanent consequence</strong> (loss of a limb, sudden death, etc., depending on the circumstances).</p>
<!--@TODO Table from p27-->

<h3>Harm examples</h3>
<p><strong>Fatal (4):</strong> <em>Electrocuted, Drowned, Stabbed in the Heart.</em></p>
<p><strong>Severe (3):</strong> <em>Impaled, Broken Leg, Shot in Chest, Badly Burned, Terrified.</em></p>
<p><strong>Moderate (2):</strong> <em>Exhausted, Deep Cut to Arm, Concussion, Panicked, Seduced.</em></p>
<p><strong>Lesser (1):</strong> <em>Battered, Drained, Distracted, Scared, Confused.</em></p>
<p>Harm like “Drained” or “Exhausted” can be a good fallback consequence if there’s nothing else threatening a PC (like when they spend all night <span class="game-term">Studying</span> those old books, looking for any clues to their enemy’s weaknesses before he strikes).</p></div></div>

<div class="collapse container-fluid main-content no-transition " id="content---game_rules---basics---resistance-md----">
   <div class="row"><div class="col section-title">Resistance & Armor</div></div>
   <div class="row"><div class="col section-text"><p><span class="author-comment"><span class="author-comment"><span class="author-comment"><span class="author-comment"><span class="author-comment">&amp;&amp;<strong>TODO: update language from Blades in the Dark</strong>&amp;&amp;</span></span></span></span></span></p>
<p>When your PC suffers a consequence that you don’t like, you can choose to resist it. Just tell the GM, “No, I don’t think so. I’m resisting that.” Resistance is always automatically effective—the GM will tell you if the consequence is reduced in severity or if you avoid it entirely. Then, you’ll make a <strong>resistance roll</strong> to see how much stress your character suffers as a result of their resistance.</p>
<p>You make the roll using one of your character’s <strong>attributes</strong> (<span class="game-term">Insight</span>, <span class="game-term">Prowess</span>, or <span class="game-term">Resolve</span>). The GM chooses the attribute, based on the nature of consequences:</p>
<ul>
<li><span class="game-term">Insight</span>: Consequences from deception or understanding.</li>
<li><span class="game-term">Prowess</span>: Consequences from physical strain or injury.</li>
<li><span class="game-term">Resolve</span>: Consequences from mental strain or willpower.</li>
</ul>
<p>Your character suffers <strong>6 stress</strong> when they resist, <strong>minus the highest die result from the resistance roll</strong>. So, if you rolled a <span class="game-term">4</span>, you’d suffer 2 stress. If you rolled a <span class="game-term">6</span>, you’d suffer zero stress. If you get a <span class="game-term">critical</span> result, you also <strong>clear 1 stress</strong>.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Ian’s character, Silas, is in a desperate <span class="game-term">Skirmish</span> with several duelists and one of them lands a blow with their sword. Since the position was desperate, the GM inflicts severe harm (modified by any other factors). They tell Ian to record level 3 harm, “Gut Stabbed” on Silas’s sheet. Ian decides to resist the harm, instead. The GM says he can reduce the harm by one level if he resists it. Ian rolls 3d for Silas’s <span class="game-term">Prowess</span> attribute and gets a <span class="game-term">5</span>. Silas takes 1 stress and the harm is reduced to level 2, “Cut to the Ribs.”</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Usually, a resistance roll <strong>reduces the severity</strong> of a consequence. If you’re going to suffer fatal harm, for example, a resistance roll would reduce the harm to severe, instead. Or if you got a complication when you were sneaking into the manor house, and the GM was going to mark three ticks on the “Alert” clock, she’d only mark two (or maybe one) if you resisted the complication.</p>
<p><strong>You may only roll against a given consequence once.</strong></p>
<p>The GM also has the option to rule that your character <strong>completely avoids</strong> the consequence. For instance, maybe you’re in a sword fight and the consequence is getting disarmed. When you resist, the GM says that you avoid that consequence completely: you keep hold of your weapon.</p>
<p><strong>By adjusting which consequences are reduced vs. which are avoided, the GM establishes the overall tone of your game</strong>. For a more daring game, most consequences will be avoided. For a grittier game, most consequences will only be reduced with resistance.</p>
<p>The GM may also threaten several consequences at once, then the player may choose which ones to resist (and make rolls for each).</p>
<blockquote>
<p>“She stabs you and then leaps off the balcony. Level 2 harm and you lose the opportunity to catch her with fighting.”</p>
<p>“I’ll resist losing the opportunity by grappling her as she attacks. She can stab me, but I don’t want to let her escape.”</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Once you decide to resist a consequence and roll, you suffer the stress indicated. You can’t roll first and see how much stress you’ll take, then decide whether or not to resist.</p>
<p>@TODO add table p29</p>
<h2>Armor</h2>
<p>If you have a type of <strong>armor</strong> that applies to the situation, you can mark an armor box to reduce or avoid a consequence, instead of rolling to resist.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Silas is taking level 2 harm, “Cut to the Ribs,” and the fight isn’t even over yet, so Ian decides to use Silas’s armor to reduce the harm. He marks the armor box and the harm becomes level 1, “Bruised.” If Silas was wearing heavy armor, he could mark a second armor box and reduce the harm again, to zero.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>When an armor box is marked, it can’t be used again until it’s restored. All of your armor is restored when you choose your <strong>load</strong> for the next score.</p>
<h2>Death</h2>
<p>There are a couple ways for a PC to die:</p>
<ul>
<li>If they suffer level 4 fatal harm and they don’t resist it, they die. <em>Sometimes this is a choice a player wants to make, because they feel like it wouldn’t make sense for the character to survive or it seems right for their character to die here.</em></li>
<li>If they need to record harm at level 3 and it’s already filled, they suffer a catastrophic consequence, which might mean sudden death (depending on the circumstances).</li>
</ul>
<p>When your character dies, you have options:</p>
<ul>
<li>You can create a new scoundrel to play. Maybe you “promote” one of the NPC gang members to a PC, or create a brand new character who joins the crew.</li>
</ul></div></div>

<p>The fortune roll is a tool the GM can use to disclaim decision making. You use a fortune roll in two different ways:</p>
<p><strong>When you need to make a determination about a situation the PCs aren’t directly involved in</strong> and don’t want to simply decide the outcome.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Two rival gands are fighting. How does that turn out? The GM makes a fortune roll for each of them. One gets a good result but the other gets limited effect. The GM decides that the first gang takes over some of their rivals’ turf but suffer some injuries during the skirmish.</p>
</blockquote>
<p><strong>When an outcome is uncertain</strong>, but no other roll applies to the situation at hand.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>While pilfering the workshop of an alchemist, Cross is possessed by a vengeful ghost. As control of his body slips away, Cross grabs a random potion bottle and drinks it down. Will the arcane concoction have an effect on the spirit? Will it poison Nock to death? Who knows? The GM makes a fortune roll to see how it turns out.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>When you make a fortune roll you may assess <strong>any trait rating</strong> to determine the dice pool of the roll.</p>
<ul>
<li>When a faction takes an action with uncertain outcome, you might use their <strong>Tier</strong> rating to make a fortune roll.</li>
<li>When a gang operates independently, use their <strong>quality</strong> rating for a fortune roll.</li>
<li>When a supernatural power manifests with uncertain results, you might use its <strong>magnitude</strong> for a fortune roll.</li>
<li>When a PC <strong>gathers information</strong>, you might make a fortune roll using their <strong>action rating</strong> to determine the amount of the info they get.</li>
</ul>
<p>If no trait applies, roll 1d for sheer luck or create a dice pool (from one to four) based on the situation at hand. If two parties are directly opposed, make a fortune roll for each side to see how they do, then assess the outcome of the situation by comparing their performance levels.</p>
<p>The fortune roll is also a good tool to help the GM manage all the various moving parts of the world. Sometimes a quick roll is enough to answer a question or inspire an idea for what might happen next.</p>
<p>Other examples of fortune rolls:</p>
<ul>
<li>The PCs instigate a war between two factions, then sit back and watch the fireworks. How does it turn out? Does either side dominate? Are they both made vulnerable by the conflict? Make a few fortune rolls to find out.</li>
<li>A strange sickness is sweeping the city. How badly is a crime ridden district hit by the outbreak? The GM assigns a magnitude to the arcane plague, and makes a fortune roll to judge the extent of its contamination.</li>
<li>The Hound stakes out a good spot and makes a sniper shot against a gang leader when he enters his office. The controlled <span class="game-term">Hunt</span> roll is a success, but is great effect enough to instantly kill a grizzled gang leader? Instead of making a progress clock for his mortality, the GM decides to use a simple fortune roll with his “toughness” as a trait to see if he can possibly survive the attack. The roll is a <span class="game-term">4/5</span>: the bullet misses his heart, but hits him in the lung—it’s a mortal wound. He’s on death’s door, with only hours to live, unless his gang can get an expert physicker to him in time.</li>
<li>Inspectors are putting a case together against the PC crew. How quickly will their evidence result in arrests? The crew’s <span class="game-term">wanted level</span> counts as a major advantage for the inspectors.</li>
<li>The PCs face off in a skirmish with a veteran demon hunter captain and her crew. The tide of battle goes in the PCs’ favor, and many crew members are killed. One of the players asks if the captain will surrender to spare the rest of her crew’s lives. The GM isn’t sure. How cold-hearted is this veteran hunter? She’s stared giant demons in the eye without flinching... is there anything human left inside her? The GM makes a 2d fortune roll for “human feelings” to see if a spark of compassion remains in heart. If so, maybe one of the PCs can roll to <span class="game-term">Consort</span>, <span class="game-term">Sway</span>, or <span class="game-term">Command</span> her to stand down.</li>

<p>The flow of information from the GM to the players about the fictional world is very important in a roleplaying game. By default, the GM tells the players what their characters perceive, suspect, and intuit. But there’s just too much going on to say <em>everything</em>—it would take forever and be boring, too. The players have a tool at their disposal to more fully investigate the fictional world.</p>
<p>When you want to know something specific about the fictional world, your character can <strong>gather information</strong>. The GM will ask you <strong>how</strong> your character gathers the info (or how they learned it in the past).</p>
<p>If it’s common knowledge, the GM will simply answer your questions. If there’s an obstacle to the discovery of the answer, an action roll is called for. If it’s not common knowledge but there’s no obstacle, a simple fortune roll determines the quality of the information you gather.</p>
<p>Each attempt to gather information takes time. If the situation allows, you can try again if you don’t initially get all the info that you want. But often, the opportunity is fleeting, and you’ll only get one chance to roll for that particular question.</p>
<p>Some example questions are on the bottom of the character sheet. The GM always answers honestly, but with a level of detail according to the level of effect.</p>
<p>The most common gather information actions are <span class="game-term">Surveying</span> the situation to reveal or anticipate what’s going on and <span class="game-term">Studying</span> a person to understand what they intend to do or what they’re really thinking.</p>
<p>Sometimes, you’ll have to maneuver yourself into position before you can gather information. For example, you might have to <span class="game-term">Prowl</span> to a good hiding place first and then <span class="game-term">Study</span> the cultists when they perform their dark ritual.</p>
<h2>Investigation</h2>
<p>Some questions are too complex to answer immediately with a single gather information roll. For instance, you might want to discover the network of contraband smuggling routes in the city. In these cases, the GM will tell you to start a <strong>long-term project</strong> that you work on during <strong>downtime</strong>.</p>
<p>You track the investigation project using a progress clock. Once the clock is filled, you have the evidence you need to ask several questions about the subject of your investigation as if you had great effect.</p>
<h2>Examples &amp; Questions</h2>
<ul>
<li>You might <span class="game-term">Attune</span> to see echoes of recent spirit activity. <em>Have any new ghosts been here? How can I find the spirit well that’s calling to them? What should I be worried about?</em></li>
<li>You might <span class="game-term">Command</span> a local barkeep to tell you what he knows about the secret meetings held in his back room. <em>What’s really going on here? What’s he really feeling about this? Is he part of this secret group?</em></li>
<li>You might <span class="game-term">Consort</span> with a well-connected friend to learn secrets about an enemy, rival, or potential ally. <em>What do they intend to do? What might I suspect about their motives? How can I discover leverage to manipulate them?</em></li>
<li>You might <span class="game-term">Hunt</span> a courier across the city, to discover who’s receiving satchels of coin from a master duelsit. <em>Where does the package end up? How can I find out who signed for the package at City Hall?</em></li>
<li>You might <span class="game-term">Study</span> ancient and obscure books to discover an arcane secret. <em>How can I disable the runes of warding? __Will anyone sense if they’re disabled?</em></li>
<li>Or you might <span class="game-term">Study</span> a person to read their intentions and feelings. <em>What are they really feeling? How could I get them to trust me?</em></li>
<li>You might <span class="game-term">Survey</span> a manor house to case it for a heist. <em>What’s a good point of infiltration? What’s the danger here?</em></li>
<li>Or you might <span class="game-term">Survey</span> a charged situation when you meet another gang. <em>What’s really going on here? Are they about to attack us?</em></li>
<li>You might <span class="game-term">Sway</span> a powerful lord at a party so he divulges his future plans. <em>What does he intend to do? How can I get him to think I might be a good partner in this venture?</em></li>

<p>While on the Ring of Earth, souls tend to clump together into <em>spirits</em>. An animal might have two or three souls in their spirit, while a magical animal (<em>wildspirit</em> or <em>tawan</em>) has five and a person has six. Each time a person is born, six souls come together into a spirit to bring them to life, and throughout that person's life, the configuration of their spirit shifts, often with the alignment of the Rings.</p>
<p><span class="game-term">Deeds</span> represent a spirit's steps on the path to Awakening—or to its ultimate fate, at least. There are four tracks of ten deeds each.

<p>At the end of session when XP is given, if the PCs did something or made a choice which had a profound impact on the world or themselves, such as raising or lowering the Tier of a faction, we award deeds. </p>

   <div class="row"><div class="col section-title">The Faction Game</div></div>
   <div class="row"><div class="col section-text"><h2>Tier</h2>
<p>Tier is the maximum power a faction can bring against obstacles. It is primarily determined by a faction's size and quality of its experts, warriors, workers, and equipment. Factions are frequently only able to bring a portion of their strength into play. </p>
<p>The Azadi Imperial Army is a Tier V faction because of its massive size and effective bureaucracy, but this is only relevant for rolls relating to the entirety of a full-scale war effort. A small imperial road patrol might only be Tier I in a fight by themselves.</p>
<p>Similarly, the Liberator's strength is primarily in her legal power, so she usually counts as her full Tier IV for related rolls. Her few dozen elite personal guards, well-trained and equipped, might be Tier III or IV in a one-on-one fight, but only count as Tier II against a much larger army of rebels.</p>
<p>You’ll use your Tier rating to roll dice when you acquire an asset, as well as for any fortune roll for which your crew’s overall power level and influence is the primary trait. Most importantly, your Tier determines the <strong>quality level</strong> of your items as well as the quality and <strong>scale</strong> of the crews in your caravan—and thereby what size of enemy you can expect to handle.</p>

<h2>Hold</h2>
<p>On the faction ladder next to the Tier numbers is a letter indicating the strength of each faction’s <strong>hold</strong>. Hold represents how well a faction can maintain their current position on the ladder. W indicates <strong>weak</strong> hold. S indicates <strong>strong</strong> hold. Your caravan begins with <strong>weak</strong> hold at <strong>Tier I</strong>.</p>
<h3>Reducing hold</h3>
<p>You may perform a hunt specifically to reduce the hold of another faction, if you know how they’re vulnerable. If the operation succeeds, the target faction loses 1 level of hold. If their hold is weak and it drops, the faction loses 1 Tier and stays weak.</p>
<p>When a faction is at war, it temporarily loses 1 hold.</p>
<p>Your caravan can lose hold, too, following the same rules above.</p>
<h2>Faction Status</h2>
<p>Your caravan's <strong>status</strong> with each faction indicates how well you are liked or hated. Status is rated from -3 to +3, with zero (neutral) being the default starting status. You track your status with each faction on the faction sheet. Faction status can also affect <strong>travel rolls</strong> and <strong>engagement rolls</strong>.</p>
<p>When you create your caravan, you assign some positive and negative status ratings to reflect recent history. The ratings will then change over time based on your actions in play.</p>
<h3>Faction status changes</h3>
<p>When you execute a hunt, you may gain -1 or -2 status with factions that are hurt by your actions. You may also gain +1 status with a faction that your hunt helps. (If you keep your operation completely quiet then your status doesn’t change.) Your status may also change if you do a favor for a faction or if you refuse one of their demands.</p>
<h3>Faction status levels</h3>
<ul>
<li><strong>+3: Allies.</strong> This faction will help you even if it’s not in their best interest to do so. They expect you to do the same for them.</li>
<li><strong>+2: Friendly.</strong> This faction will help you if it doesn’t create serious problems for them. They expect you to do the same.</li>
<li><strong>+1: Helpful.</strong> This faction will help you if it causes no problems or significant cost for them. They expect the same from you.</li>
<li><strong>0: Neutral</strong></li>
<li><strong>-1: Interfering.</strong> This faction will look for opportunities to cause trouble for you (or profit from your misfortune) as long as it causes no problems or significant cost for them. They expect the same from you.</li>
<li><strong>-2: Hostile.</strong> This faction will look for opportunities to hurt you as long as it doesn’t create serious problems for them. They expect you to do the same, and take precautions against you.</li>
<li><strong>-3: War.</strong> This faction will go out of its way to hurt you even if it’s not in their best interest to do so. They expect you to do the same, and take precautions against you. When you’re at war with any number of factions, PCs get only <strong>1 free downtime action</strong> if they're in an area the faction has influence in, and they earn <strong>-1 renown</strong> from each hunt if the sum of the factions' tiers is greater than or equal to the caravan's tier. You can end a war by eliminating your enemy or by negotiating a mutual agreement to establish a new status rating.</li>

   <div class="row"><div class="col section-title">Advancement</div></div>
   <div class="row"><div class="col section-text"><h2>God-Hunter Advancement</h2>
<p>Each player keeps track of the experience points (<strong>xp</strong>) that their character earns.</p>
<p>During the game session, mark xp:</p>
<ul>
<li>When you make a <strong>desperate action roll</strong>. Mark 1 xp. When you roll in a <strong>group action</strong> that’s desperate, you still mark xp.</li>
</ul>
<p>At the end of the session, review the <strong>xp triggers</strong> on your character sheet. For each one, mark 1 xp if it happened at all, or mark 2 xp if it happened a lot during the session. The xp triggers are:</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Your playbook-specific xp trigger</strong>. For example, the Baghatur’s is <em>“Address a challenge with violence or daring.”</em> To “address a challenge,” your character should attempt to overcome a tough obstacle or threat. It doesn’t matter if the action is successful or not. You get xp either way.</li>
<li><strong>You expressed your bond, alignments, heritage, or background.</strong> Your character’s beliefs and drives are yours to define, session to session. Feel free to tell the group about them when you mark xp.</li>
<li><strong>You struggled with issues from your sacrifices</strong>. Mark xp for this if your sacrifices caused you trouble.</li>
</ul>
<p>When you fill an xp track, clear all the marks and increase your <strong>level</strong>. Follow the level-up chart on the second page of the character sheet to see what you earn at each level.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Example goes here todo</p>
</blockquote>
<p>You can also earn xp by <strong>training</strong> during downtime. When you train, you spend a downtime action and mark 1 xp.  <strong>You must have another god-hunter of a higher level to help you in order to train.</strong> They don't need to spend a downtime action.</p>
<h2>Caravan Advancement</h2>
<p>At the end of the session, review the caravan xp triggers and mark 1 caravan xp for each item that occurred during the session. If an item occurred multiple times or in a major way, mark 2 caravan xp for it. The caravan xp triggers are:</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Complete a successful hunt.</strong></li>
<li><strong>Contend with challenges above your current station.</strong> If you tangled with higher Tiers or more dangerous opposition, mark xp for this.</li>
<li><strong>Make significant progress towards the caravan's goal.</strong></li>
</ul>
<p><strong>When you fill your caravan xp tracker</strong>, advance to the next <span class="game-term">Tier</span> by spending 4 x the new Tier in <span class="game-term">dragonsilk</span> (Tier I Strong to Tier II Weak, Tier II Weak to Tier II Strong, etc.). This increases the maximum camp size.</p>

<h4>Name, Pronouns, Look</h4>
<p>What do they call you and what do you look like?</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Let's create Setareh, a Baghatur. She looks scrappy, with wild hair and a couple of missing teeth. She's usually in a red dragonsilk vest and a pair of comfortable boots.</p>
</blockquote>
<h4>Bond</h4>
<p>Your character's <span class="game-term">bond</span> is something that drives them on. It's separate from their duties as god-hunter. You spend downtime to <strong>address your bond</strong> to restore your <span class="game-term">spirit</span>. What soothes your character's weary souls?</p>

<p>Your <span class="game-term">stars alignment</span> is an aspect of your people, described in association to the <strong>Celestials</strong>, constellations in the Ring of Stars which are thought to represent Awakened ancestor spirits. The common names of the Celestials are:</p>
<ul>
<li>Deer</li>

<li><span class="game-term">Trade</span></li>
</ul>
<p>Your <span class="game-term">seasons alignment</span> is an aspect of yourself, related to four parts of the Ring of Seasons: Spring, Summer, Autumn, Winter. Pick a <span class="game-term">background</span> and a <span class="game-term">season</span>. <strong>Tell us a little about yourself and answer the question, "how am I like (e.g.) spring?"</strong> Your alignment with the Ring of Seasons may change as the seasons turn.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Setareh's background is <strong>Outlaw</strong>. Naive and strapped for cash, Setareh took up with a bandit gang before becoming a god-hunter, earning herself many enemies. Her continued hope in her search for her family and her ready trust in others make her like <strong>Spring</strong>, her seasons alignment.</p>
</blockquote>
<h4>Spirit</h4>
<p><span class="game-term">Spirit</span> is a resource used throughout many aspects of God-Hunter. It represents your drive to carry on, your reserve of metaphysical energy, or your good luck. Your maximum is 12. Spending all of your spirit means you die (dying is rarely permanent for god-hunters). You address your bond in downtime to restore it.</p>

<p><strong>Poets</strong> work a little differently. You start with a story ability, and you gain a story or regular ability when you fill your class XP track. You can't take additional story abilities until you have at least as many regular abilities.</p>

</div>



<div class="collapse container-fluid main-content no-transition " id="content---game_rules---hunt---hunt_overview-md----">
   <div class="row"><div class="col section-title">Hunt Overview</div></div>
   <div class="row"><div class="col section-text"><p>In <em>God-Hunter</em>, our characters are oath-bound to protect the Wheel and its people from all threats—supernatural or otherwise. Society usually expects this to take place in the form of tracking down and killing the monsters that plague them, as even veteran soldiers lack the fortitude to resist the unnatural terror that monsters radiate. A god-hunter's methods work just as well against common bandits on the road and the corrupt rulers who push the narrative that god-hunters should stay out of their affairs.</p>
<p>In either case, in order to keep their bellies filled and oaths fulfilled, god-hunters must engage in <strong>hunts</strong>.</p>
<p>A hunt is a single operation with a particular goal: <em>break the town's curse, slay the nearby demons, collect dirt on the local lord,</em> etc. Hunts fall into two categories:</p>
<ul>
<li>We're <strong>the hunters</strong>. Whether it's simple monster-slaying work or something more involved, we choose the target, time, and place and set out from the caravan to complete our goal.</li>
<li>We're <strong>the hunted</strong>. While in the middle of something else, such as traveling or gathering information, we (and possibly the caravan or nearby settlement) come under attack. We have less control over the situation.</li>
</ul>
<p>A hunt can be long and involved or short and sweet. There might be lots of rolls and trouble, or just a few actions to resolve it. <em>Play to find out what happens!</em> A hunt doesn't need to fill one session of play every
time. Let it be however long it is.</p>
<p>A hunt consists of a few key elements, detailed in this chapter: <strong>engagement</strong>, <strong>flashbacks</strong>, and <strong>teamwork</strong>.</p></div></div>
</div>



<div class="collapse container-fluid main-content no-transition " id="content---game_rules---hunt---planning-md----">
   <div class="row"><div class="col section-title">Planning & Engagement</div></div>
   <div class="row"><div class="col section-text"><h2>When we're the hunters</h2>
<p>When we've chosen a target and know roughly where to find it, we leave the caravan behind. We're on the hunt. Our characters make plans off-screen, but we skip straight to the first moment of tension. To see how well things are going when the hunt begins, we make an <strong>engagement roll</strong>. The dice are assembled as follows:</p>
<p><strong>+1d</strong> for sheer luck<br>
<strong>+1d</strong> if their Tier is lower<br>
<strong>+1d</strong> if any of our friends or contacts can lend insight or aid<br>
<strong>-1d</strong> if any enemies or rivals seek to interfere<br>
<strong>-1d</strong> if their Tier is higher<br>
<strong>-1d</strong> if we don't know what sort of creature our target is<br>
+any other major advantages/disadvantages</p>
<p><strong>Results</strong>:</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Critical</strong>: Exceptional result. You’ve already overcome the first obstacle and you’re in a controlled position for what’s next.</li>
<li><strong>6</strong>: Good result. You’re in a controlled position when the action starts.</li>
<li><strong>4/5</strong>: Mixed result. You’re in a risky position when the action starts.</li>
<li><strong>1-3</strong>: Bad result. You’re in a desperate position when the action starts.</li>
</ul>
<p>The engagement roll assumes that the PCs are approaching the target as intelligently as they can, given the plan and detail they provided, so we don’t need to play out tentative probing maneuvers, special precautions, or other ponderous non-action. The engagement roll covers all of that. The PCs are already in action, facing the first obstacle—up on the rooftop, picking the lock on the window; kicking down the door of the monsters' lair; maneuvering to speak with a lord at the feast; etc.</p>
<p>Don’t make the engagement roll and then describe the PCs approaching the target. It’s the approach that the engagement roll resolves. Cut to the action that results because of that initial approach—to the first serious obstacle in their path.</p>
<p>If the players want to include a special preparation or clever setup, they can do so with flashbacks during the hunt. This takes some getting used to. Players may balk at first, worried that you’re skipping over important things that they want to do. But jumping straight into the action of the hunt is much more effective once you get used to it. When they see the situation they’re in, their “planning” in flashbacks will be focused and useful, rather than merely speculations on circumstances and events that might not even happen.</p>
<h2>When we're the hunted</h2>
<p>We don't always get the drop on our enemies. Sometimes they come leaping from ambush or charging at us from just across the plain—swords drawn or claws bared. When we're the hunted, we still make an engagement roll, but with dice equal to our <span class="game-term">Tier - 1</span>. Some caravan upgrades can modify this.</p>
<p>All flashbacks cost <span class="game-term">+1 spirit</span> when we're being hunted.</p>
<h2>Flashbacks</h2>
<p>The rules don’t distinguish between actions performed in the present moment and those performed in the past. When an operation is underway, you can invoke a <strong>flashback</strong> to roll for an action in the past that impacts your current situation. Maybe you asked the locals to keep a curfew tonight, so you make a <span class="game-term">Convince</span> roll to see how that went.</p>
<p>The GM sets a <strong>spirit cost</strong> when you activate a flashback action.</p>
<ul>
<li><span class="game-term">0 </span><span class="game-term">Spirit:</span> An ordinary action for which you had easy opportunity. <em>The Baghatur </em><span class="game-term">Consorted</span><em> with her friend to agree to arrive at the tavern ahead of time, to suddenly spring out as a surprise ally.</em></li>
<li><span class="game-term">1 </span><span class="game-term">Spirit:</span> A complex action or unlikely opportunity. <em>The Stalker </em><span class="game-term">Fashioned</span><em> a trap to send a pile of logs barrelling down the hill when the beast crosses the bridge.</em></li>
<li><span class="game-term">2 </span><span class="game-term">(or more) Spirit:</span> An elaborate action that involved special opportunities or contingencies. <em>The Warden has already </em><span class="game-term">Surveyed</span><em> these woods and learned of a wildspirit that is known to roost in a lightning-scarred tree at their center—a wildspirit that can be persuaded to reveal the location of the otherworldly forces here.</em></li>
</ul>
<p>After the spirit cost is paid, a flashback action is handled just like any other action. Sometimes it will entail an action roll, because there’s some danger or trouble involved. Sometimes a flashback will entail a fortune roll, because we just need to find out how well (or how much, or how long, etc.). Sometimes a flashback won’t call for a roll at all because you can just pay the spirit and it’s accomplished.</p>
<p>If a flashback involves a <strong>downtime</strong> activity, pay 1 <span class="game-term">dragonsilk</span> or 1 <span class="game-term">renown</span> for it, instead of spirit.</p>
<p>One of the best uses for a flashback is when the <strong>engagement roll</strong> goes badly. After the GM describes the trouble you’re in, you can call for a flashback to a special preparation you made, “just in case” something like this happened. This way, your “flashback planning” will be focused on the problems that <em>do</em> happen, not the problems that <em>might</em> happen.</p>
<h3>Limits of flashbacks</h3>
<p>A flashback isn’t time travel. It can’t “undo” something that just occurred in the present moment. For instance, if rival god-hunters show up to claim credit for your work, you can’t call for a flashback to have them waylaid the night before. They're here now, challenging you—that’s established in the fiction. You <em>can</em> call for a flashback to show that you stole their fabricated proof.</p>
<h2>Giving up on a hunt</h2>
<p>When you give up on a hunt, you go into <strong>downtime</strong>. Follow the phases for downtime presented in the next chapter. You’ll usually have zero <strong>payoff</strong>, since you didn’t accomplish anything. You’ll still face <strong>portents</strong> as usual.</p></div></div>
</div>



<div class="collapse container-fluid main-content no-transition " id="content---game_rules---hunt---teamwork-md----">
   <div class="row"><div class="col section-title">Teamwork</div></div>
   <div class="row"><div class="col section-text"><p>When the team of PCs works together, the characters have access to four special <strong>teamwork maneuvers</strong>. They’re listed at the bottom of the character playbook sheets to help remind the players of them. The four maneuvers are:</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Assist</strong> another PC who’s rolling an action.</li>
<li>Lead a <strong>group action</strong>.</li>
<li><strong>Protect</strong> a teammate.</li>
<li><strong>Set up</strong> a character who will follow through on your action.</li>
</ul>
<h3>Assist</h3>
<p>When you assist another player who’s rolling, describe what your character does to help. Spend 1 spirit and give them <strong>+1d</strong> to their roll. You might also suffer any consequences that occur because of the roll, depending on the circumstances. Only one character may assist a given roll. <em>If you really want to help and someone else is already assisting, consider performing a <strong>setup</strong> maneuver instead.</em></p>
<p>A character may assist a group action, but only if they aren’t taking part in it directly. You decide which character in the group action gets the bonus die.</p>
<h3>Lead a group action</h3>
<p>When you lead a group action, you coordinate multiple members of the team to tackle a problem together. Describe how your character leads the team in a coordinated effort. Do you bark orders, give subtle hand signals, or provide charismatic inspiration?</p>
<p>Each PC who’s involved makes an <strong>action roll</strong> (using the same action) and <strong>the team counts the single best result</strong> as the overall effort for everyone who rolled. However, the character leading the group action spends <strong>1 spirit</strong> for each PC that rolled<span class="game-term"> 1-3</span> as their best result.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>This is how you do the “we all sneak into the building” scene. Everyone who wants to sneak in rolls their Prowl action, and the best result counts for the whole team. The leader suffers stress for everyone who does poorly. It’s tough covering for the stragglers.</p>
</blockquote>
<p><strong>The group action result covers everyone who rolled.</strong> If you don’t roll, your character doesn’t get the effects of the action.</p>
<p>Your character doesn’t have to be especially skilled at the action at hand in order to lead a group action. This maneuver is about leadership, not necessarily about ability. You can also lead your caravan’s <strong>cohorts</strong> with a group action. Roll <span class="game-term">Command</span> if you direct their efforts, or roll the appropriate action rating if you participate alongside them. The cohort rolls its <strong>quality</strong> level.</p>
<h3>Protect</h3>
<p>You step in to face a consequence that one of your teammates would otherwise face. <strong>You suffer it instead of them. You may roll to resist it as normal.</strong> Describe how you intervene.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>This is how you do the “I’ll dive in front of the arrows”. You cover for a teammate, suffering any harm or consequences that still linger after you’ve rolled to resist. It hurts, cost spirit, and may leave you in a bad spot. But hey, you’re a hero.</p>
</blockquote>
<h3>Set up</h3>
<p>When you perform a setup action, you have an indirect effect on an obstacle. If your action has its intended result, any member of the team who follows through on your maneuver gets <strong>+1 effect level</strong> or <strong>improved position</strong> for their roll. You choose the benefit, based on the nature of your setup action.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>This is how you do the “I’ll create a distraction” scene. You roll <span class="game-term">Convince</span> to distract a guard with your charms, then any teammate who follows through with a <span class="game-term">Prowl</span> action to sneak past him can get improved position. It’s less risky since you’re drawing the guard’s attention.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>This is a good way to contribute to an operation when you don’t have a good rating in the action at hand. A clever setup action lets you help the team indirectly. Multiple follow-up actions may take advantage of your setup (including someone <strong>leading</strong> a group action) as long as it makes sense in the fiction.</p>
<p>Since a setup action can increase the effect of follow-up actions, it’s also useful when the team is facing tough opposition that has advantages in quality, scale, and/or potency. Even if the PCs are reduced to zero effect due to disadvantages in a situation, the setup action provides a bonus that allows for limited effect.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>The PCs are facing a heavily armored tuguai that’s immune to their weapons. Kithrai uses <span class="game-term">Wreck</span> as a setup action to pry some of the armor loose with his crowbar, giving follow up actions +1 effect—going from zero to limited effect.</p>
</blockquote>
<h2>Do we have to use teamwork?</h2>
<p>Teamwork maneuvers are options, not requirements. Each character can still perform solo actions as normal during an operation. If your character can’t communicate or somehow coordinate with the rest of the team, you can’t use or benefit from any teamwork maneuvers.</p></div></div>
</div>



<div class="collapse container-fluid main-content no-transition " id="content---game_rules---downtime---downtime_overview-md----">
   <div class="row"><div class="col section-title">Downtime Overview</div></div>
   <div class="row"><div class="col section-text"><p>After we finish a hunt (succeed or fail), we review what's been going on outside it. This phase is called <strong>downtime</strong>.</p>
<p>Downtime time fulfills two purposes in the game:</p>
<ul>
<li>First, it’s a break for the players. During the action of the hunt, the PCs are always under threat, charging from obstacle to obstacle in a high-energy sequence. Downtime gives them a reprieve so they can catch their breath and relax a bit—focus on lower-energy, quieter elements of the game, as well as explore personal aspects of their characters.</li>
<li>Second, the shift into a new phase of the game signals a shift in which mechanics are needed. There are special rules that are only used during the downtime phase, so they’re kept “out of the way” during the other parts of play. When we shift into downtime, we take out a different toolbox and resolve downtime on its own terms, then shift back into the more action-focused phases of the game afterwards.</li>
</ul>
<p>Downtime is divided into three parts, which are usually resolved in this order:</p>
<ol>
<li><span class="game-term">Payoff.</span> The god-hunters receive their rewards from a successfully completed hunt.</li>
<li><span class="game-term">Portents.</span> What's the fallout from the hunt? What threats are advancing in the background?</li>
<li><span class="game-term">Downtime Activities.</span> The hunters address their bonds, work on long-term projects, recover from injuries, etc.</li>
</ol>
<p>After the downtime activities are resolved, the game returns to free play, and the group can move toward their next hunt.</p></div></div>
</div>



<div class="collapse container-fluid main-content no-transition " id="content---game_rules---downtime---payoff-md----">
   <div class="row"><div class="col section-title">Payoff, Renown, & Dragonsilk</div></div>
   <div class="row"><div class="col section-text"><p>After a hunt, the PCs take stock of their earnings. A successful hunt can generate both <span class="game-term">renown</span> and <span class="game-term">dragonsilk</span>.</p>
<h2>Renown</h2>
<p><span class="game-term">Renown</span> is a measure of the god-hunters' fame and reputation and the willingness of people to aid them or join up with their caravan.</p>
<h4>Earning Renown</h4>
<p>The caravan earns 2 <span class="game-term">renown</span> per hunt by default. If the target of the score is higher Tier than you, take <strong>+1 </strong><span class="game-term">renown</span><strong> per Tier higher</strong>. If the target of the hunt is lower Tier, you get <strong>-1 </strong><span class="game-term">renown</span><strong> per Tier lower</strong> (minimum zero).</p>
<blockquote>
<p>If your caravan is Tier I and you pull off a successful hunt against a Tier III target, you earn 4 <span class="game-term">renown</span> (2 <span class="game-term">renown</span>, +2 <span class="game-term">renown</span> for a target two tiers above you). If your caravan is Tier III and you complete a hunt against a Tier I target, you earn 0 <span class="game-term">renown</span> (2 renown, -2 renown for the lower Tier target).</p>
</blockquote>
<p>If the hunt was done in complete secret, you earn 0 <span class="game-term">renown</span>. Mark any earned <span class="game-term">renown</span> on the renown tracker on the caravan sheet.</p>
<h4>Spending Renown</h4>
<ul>
<li>Spend 1 <span class="game-term">renown</span> to get an additional <span class="game-term">downtime activity</span></li>
<li>If your <span class="game-term">renown</span> tracker is full, you may empty it and spend 2 <span class="game-term">dragonsilk</span> to increase your <span class="game-term">camp size</span>, up to its maximum</li>
</ul>
<h2>Dragonsilk</h2>
<p><span class="game-term">Dragonsilk</span> is an abstract measure of money and liquid assets. Bolts of dragonsilk—significantly smaller than a bolt of linen—are used as a medium of exchange for large purchases or to measure the wealth of large amounts of local currency or valuables. The few bits the PCs use in their daily lives are not tracked.</p>
<h4>Earning Dragonsilk</h4>
<p>The caravan earns treasure valued in <span class="game-term">dragonsilk</span> based on the nature of the hunt and/or any loot they gathered.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>The world's only known dragon eggs have never hatched over the centuries, but they continue to secrete dragonsilk—shimmering, smooth, and strong as steel. Its rarity and usefulness in creating armor, enchantments, and spark-craft lend it great value.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Here are some possible rewards and their approximate value:</p>

<th align="center">Dragonsilk</th>

</table>
<p>Record the <span class="game-term">dragonsilk</span> on the caravan sheet, or divvy it up among the god-hunters as you see fit. More than 4 <span class="game-term">dragonsilk</span> worth of treasure is an impractical amount to keep lying around. You must spend the excess or store it with your caravan.</p>
<p>One bolt of <span class="game-term">dragonsilk</span> or its equivalent in other currency takes up one <span class="game-term">load</span> when carried.</p>
<h4>Spending Dragonsilk</h4>
<ul>
<li>Spend 1 <span class="game-term">dragonsilk</span> to get an additional <span class="game-term">downtime activity</span></li>
<li>Spend 1 <span class="game-term">dragonsilk</span> to increase the result level of an <span class="game-term">acquire asset</span>, <span class="game-term">long-term project</span>, <span class="game-term">recover</span>, or <span class="game-term">resupply</span> roll</li>
<li>Spend 2 <span class="game-term">dragonsilk</span> to increase the result level of a <span class="game-term">crafting</span> or <span class="game-term">ritual</span> roll</li>
<li>If your <span class="game-term">renown</span> tracker is full, you may empty it and spend 2 <span class="game-term">dragonsilk</span> to increase your <span class="game-term">camp size</span>, up to its maximum</li>
<li>Spend 2 x your <span class="game-term">Tier</span> to reallocate your <span class="game-term">camp selections</span> and change your <span class="game-term">cohorts</span></li>
<li>Spend 4 x the new <span class="game-term">Tier</span> in <span class="game-term">dragonsilk</span> and clear a full <span class="game-term">XP</span> tracker to advance your caravan's <span class="game-term">Tier</span></li>

   <div class="row"><div class="col section-text"><p><span class="game-term">Portents</span> are like clocks with dark omens attached—the signs and rumors of troublesome powers working in the background.

<ol>
<li>Did the hunt affect any factions? The GM may change their <span class="game-term">Tier</span> and <span class="game-term">hold</span> or the caravan's <span class="game-term">status</span> with them accordingly.</li>

<h2>Campaign Portents</h2>
<p>At the start of the game, the players and GM come up with two <span class="game-term">campaign troubles</span>, themes which roughly outline what the game will be about. With the players' consent, one or both may be chosen in secret by the GM. Additional troubles may arise naturally in play. For each trouble, the GM writes out a list of portents—events which escalate the trouble or show its ever increasing size and threat. The only portent you really need to know is the <em>next one</em>, and you can modify your lists of portents at any time.</p>

<h2>Foe Portents</h2>
<p>These are portents for specific enemies, usually more local to the area the god-hunters are in. They advance just as campaign portents do. See <a aria-controls="content---setting---foes---foes_overview-md----" aria-expanded="false"
class="collapsed" data-toggle="collapse" href="#content---setting---foes---foes_overview-md----" role="button">Foes Overview</a> for examples.</p>
<h2>Advancing Portents</h2>
<p>Following a hunt, the GM may mark off the next portent and describe it to the players—the god-hunters see a storm gathering in the far distance, overhear whispers of a certain name at the tavern, or observe inauspicious signs in the stars that night. The GM might show an aside to the players that the characters aren't privy to—strangers dying in unknown battles, hooded figures engaging in bloody rituals.</p>
<p>Both campaign portents and foe portents can be world-spanning in scale. They are throttle the GM can adjust. You don't need to advance them following a hunt if tensions are already high or the players could use a moment to soak in their victories.</p>
<p>Just like ticking clocks, advancing portents can also be a consequence for a roll or an exchange for a <span class="game-term">divine bargain</span>.</p></div></div>
</div>



<div class="collapse container-fluid main-content no-transition " id="content---game_rules---downtime---downtime_activities-md----">
   <div class="row"><div class="col section-title">Downtime Activities</div></div>
   <div class="row"><div class="col section-text"><p>After a hunt, we review what the god-hunters have been up to in their free time. God-hunters have time for 2 <span class='game-term'>downtime activities</span> after payoff and portents—or only one, if you're at war with a faction in the area. Additional activities may be purchased 1-for-1 with <span class='game-term'>dragonsilk</span> or <span class='game-term'>renown</span>. The available activities are:</p>
<ul>
<li><span class='game-term'>Acquire Asset</span></li>
<li><span class='game-term'>Address Bond</span></li>
<li><span class='game-term'>Craft</span></li>
<li><span class='game-term'>Long-Term Project</span></li>
<li><span class='game-term'>Recover</span></li>
<li><span class='game-term'>Resupply</span></li>
<li><span class='game-term'>Rituals</span></li>
<li><span class='game-term'>Train</span></li>
</ul>
<p>You may choose the same activity more than once. You can only attempt actions that you're in a position to accomplish. If an activity is contingent on another action, resolve that action first.</p>
<p>Activities on the downtime list are limited; normal actions are not. During downtime, you can still go places, do things, make action rolls, gather information, talk with other characters, etc. In other words, only activities that are <em>on the list</em> are limited.</p>
<p>For any downtime activity, take <strong>+1d</strong> to the roll if a <span class='game-term'>friend</span> helps you. After the roll, you may spend <span class='game-term'>dragonsilk</span> to improve the result level. Spend 1 <span class='game-term'>dragonsilk</span> to increase the result level of an <strong>acquire asset</strong>, <strong>long-term project</strong>, <strong>recover</strong>, or <strong>resupply</strong> roll. Spend 2 dragonsilk to increase the result level of a <strong>crafting</strong> or <strong>ritual</strong> roll. So, a 1-3 result becomes a 4 or a 5, a 4/5 result becomes a 6, and a 6 becomes a critical.</p>
<p><strong>GM:</strong> If a player can’t decide which downtime activity to pick, offer them a long-term project idea. You know what the player is interested in and what they like. Suggest a project that will head in a fun direction for them.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>“Remember how you had that weird vision at the altar to the Old Gods? Yeah, do you want to get to the bottom of that? Okay, start a long-term project—six segments—called... ‘Weird God Vibes.’ What do you do to work on that?”</p>
</blockquote>
<h3>Acquire Asset</h3>
<p>Gain temporary use of an <span class='game-term'>asset</span>:</p>
<ul>
<li>One special <span class='game-term'>item</span> or set of common items (enough for a gang of your Tier scale)</li>
<li>A <span class='game-term'>cohort</span> (an expert or crew).</li>
<li>A <span class='game-term'>vehicle</span>.</li>
<li>A <span class='game-term'>service</span>. Transport from a smuggler, use of a warehouse for temporary storage, legal representation, etc.</li>
</ul>
<p>“Temporary use” constitutes one significant period of usage that makes sense for the asset—typically the duration of one hunt. An asset may also be acquired for “standby” use in the future. You might hire a crew to guard your caravan, for example, and they’ll stick around until after the first serious battle, or until a week or two goes by and they lose interest.</p>
<p>To acquire the asset, roll the crew’s Tier<span class="game-term CharOverride-15">.</span> The result indicates the <strong>quality</strong> of the asset you get, using the crew’s Tier as the base. <span class="game-term">1-3:</span> Tier -1, <span class="game-term">4/5:</span> Tier, <span class="game-term">6:</span> Tier +1, <span class="game-term">critical:</span> Tier +2. You can spend <span class="game-term">coin</span> to raise the result of this roll beyond <span class="game-term">critical</span> by spending <strong>2</strong> <span class="game-term">coin</span> per additional Tier level added.</p>
<p>The GM may set a <strong>minimum quality</strong> level that must be achieved to acquire a particular asset. For example, if you want to get a set of Warden uniforms and masks, you’d need to acquire a Tier III asset. A lower result won’t do.</p>
<p>If you acquire the same asset again, you get <strong>+1d</strong> to your roll. If you continue to re-acquire an asset every time it’s used, you can effectively rent it indefinitely.</p>
<p>Alchemicals, poisons, bombs, and dangerous gadgets are highly restricted. When you acquire one of these items (rather than crafting it yourself), you advance a <span class="game-term">portent</span>—OR—lower <span class="game-term">status</span> with a faction.</p>
<p>If you want to acquire an asset permanently, you can either gain it as a crew upgrade or work on it as a <strong>long-term project</strong> to set up a permanent acquisition.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Setareh the Baghatur would like a fine sword to add to her permanent items. Her player starts a long-term project: “Get My Family Sword Back from the Pawnbroker.” The GM says this is an 8-clock (she can work on it by <span class="game-term">Consorting</span> or <span class="game-term">Convincing</span> the pawnbroker or maybe spending small amounts of dragonsilk).</p>
</blockquote>
<h3>Address Bond</h3>
<p>A god-hunter is a god-hunter for life, and it's not an easy one. The constant danger drains your spirit. In order to find the strength to press on and restore your spirit, you must confront your bond—that which drives you forward, brings you joy, or gives you hope.</p>
<p>When you address your bond, roll dice equal to your lowest attribute—your bond exposes what you're most vulnerable to. Restore spirit boxes equal to the highest die result. On a crit, you choose how many boxes to restore, up to 6.</p>
<p>If you restore more spirit boxes than you had marked off, you feel the <span class="game-term>tug of fate</span>—your bond and your duties as god-hunter come into conflict. Choose one:</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Gone Astray:</strong> Your character disappears to deal with something else for a few days to a few weeks—enough that they miss out on a hunt or two. Play another character until they return. When they do, all their harm is healed.</li>
<li><strong>Distracted:</strong> Your thoughts are elsewhere. Next hunt, you take -1d to all resistance rolls.</li>
<li><strong>Tapped:</strong> Your bond asks too much from you, and you can't continue on like this. Abandon this bond and choose a new one.</li>
<li><strong>Sulk:</strong> Your temper causes you to act foolish or lash out. People take notice, and their faith in you is shaken. The caravan loses -2 <span class="game-term>renown</span>.</li>
</ul>
<h3>Craft</h3>
<p>See <a aria-controls="content---game_rules---downtime---crafting-md----" aria-expanded="false"
class="collapsed" data-toggle="collapse" href="#content---game_rules---downtime---crafting-md----" role="button">Crafting</a>.</p>
<h3>Long-term project</h3>
<p>When you work on a long-term project (either a brand new one, or an already existing one), describe what your character does to advance the project clock, and roll one of your actions. Mark segments on the clock according to your result: <span class="game-term">1-3:</span> one segment, <span class="game-term">4/5:</span> two segments, <span class="game-term">6:</span> three segments, <span class="game-term">critical:</span> five segments.</p>
<p>A long-term project can cover a wide variety of activities, like doing research into an arcane ritual, investigating a mystery, establishing someone’s trust, courting a new friend or contact, and so on.</p>
<p>Based on the goal of the project, the GM will tell you the clock(s) to create and suggest a method by which you might make progress.</p>
<p>In order to work on a project, you might first have to achieve the means to pursue it—which can be a project in itself. For example, you might want to make friends with a member of the City Council, but you have no connection to them. You could first work on a project to <span class="game-term">Consort</span> in their circles so you have the opportunity to meet one of them. Once that’s accomplished, you could start a new project to form a friendly relationship.</p>
<h3>Recover</h3>
<p>When you recover, you seek treatment and heal your harm. You might visit a physicker who can stitch your wounds and soothe your mind with anatomical science or a witch who specializes in healing charms and restorative alchemy. If you don’t have a contact or fellow PC who can provide treatment, you can use the <strong>acquire asset</strong> activity to gain access to a healer, who can provide service for the whole crew.</p>
<p>Recovery is like a long-term project. Your healer rolls (<span class="game-term">Fashion</span> for a PC with the <span class="game-term">Physicker</span> special ability or the <strong>quality</strong> level of an NPC) and then you mark a number of segments on your <strong>healing clock</strong>. <span class="game-term">1-3:</span> one segment, <span class="game-term">4/5:</span> two segments, <span class="game-term">6:</span> three segments, <span class="game-term">critical:</span> five segments.</p>
<p>When you fill your healing clock, reduce each instance of harm on your sheet by one level, then clear the clock. If you have more segments to mark, they “roll over.”</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Yarek has two injuries: a level 3 “Shattered Right Leg” and level 1 “Battered.” During downtime, he gets treatment from Tashi, one of the caravan's experts. The caravan's Tier is I, so since Tashi's an expert, she gets 2 dice. The player rolls 2d to recover and gets a <span class="game-term">6</span>: three segments on the healing clock. He decides to spend 1 <span class="game-term">dragonsilk</span> to improve the result to a <span class="game-term">critical</span> to get five segments instead. Four segments fill the clock—all of Yarek’s harm is reduced by one level, then he clears the clock and marks one more segment. His level 3 harm “Shattered Right Leg” is reduced to level 2 harm. His level 1 harm “Battered” is reduced to zero and goes away. Yarek is left with one injury on his sheet: level 2 “Broken Leg.”</p>
</blockquote>
<p>You may heal yourself if you have the <span class="game-term">Physicker</span> special ability, but you spend 2 spirit when you do so. You can also choose to simply tough it out and attempt to heal without any treatment—in this case, spend 1 spirit and roll 0d.</p>
<p>Note that it’s the recovering character that takes the recovery action. Healing someone else does not cost a downtime activity for the healer.</p>
<p>Whenever you suffer new harm, clear any ticks on your healing clock.</p>
<h3>Resupply</h3>
<p>When you resupply, roll your <span class="game-term">Tier</span> and gain that many supplies, up to the maximum the caravan can carry.</p>
<p>If you're in an inhabited place, you may reallocate your caravan's <strong>camp selections</strong> by spending <strong>2 x your <span class="game-term">Tier</span></strong> in <span class="game-term">dragonsilk</span>. You can also spend your <span class="game-term">Tier</span> in <span class="game-term">dragonsilk</span> to change your cohorts.</p>
<p>If someone's around to trade them with you, you may choose different <span class="game-term">pack beasts</span> for your caravan. If the beasts you're after are especially rare or valuable, you might need to spend <span class="game-term">dragonsilk</span>, too.</p>
<h3>Rituals</h3>
<p>See <a aria-controls="content---game_rules---downtime---ritual-md----" aria-expanded="false"
class="collapsed" data-toggle="collapse" href="#content---game_rules---downtime---ritual-md----" role="button">Rituals</a>.</p>
<h3>Train</h3>
<p>In order to train effectively, you must have another god-hunter of a higher level to help you out. They don't need to spend a downtime action to help you train. When you spend time in training, <strong>mark 1 xp</strong>. If you have the appropriate camp selection, mark <strong>+1 <span class="game-term"> </span>xp</strong> (2 total). <em>You can train a given xp track only once per downtime.</em></p></div></div>

<div class="collapse container-fluid main-content no-transition " id="content---game_rules---downtime---rituals-md----">
   <div class="row"><div class="col section-title">Rituals</div></div>
   <div class="row"><div class="col section-text"><p>To enact a ritual is to bend natural law or come into contact with supernatural forces and entreat them to do your will. It is a practice not without considerable risk.</p>
<h2>Finding a ritual source</h2>
<p>A PC with a <span class="game-term">Ritual</span> special ability begins with one known ritual, already learned (answer the questions below to create it). To learn a new ritual, a PC must first find a <strong>source</strong>. A source may be secured as payoff from a hunt—perhaps the Imperial College offers a ritual scroll in lieu of traditional payment. You might also secure a source as the goal of a long-term project—by consorting with cultist friends, studying ancient texts, or some other method you devise.</p>
<h2>Learning a ritual</h2>
<p>Once the source of a ritual is found, you may undertake a long-term project to learn the ritual. Most rituals will require an 8-segment progress clock to learn. The player and the GM answer questions (determined by whether it is a <strong>cosmological</strong> or <strong>evocation</strong> ritual) about the ritual to define what it will do in play and what is required to perform it (see below). The player records these answers in their notes for future reference.</p>
<h3>Cosmological Ritual Questions</h3>
<p>These rituals tap into natural properties of the universe, leveraging exploits in the Algorithm to make subtle manipulations to its code. You might change a lake's water to fire, shift yourself into the Ring of Stars or Seasons, cause a snag in time, or double the force of gravity.</p>
<ol>
<li>GM asks: <strong>“What does the ritual do, and how is it weird?”</strong> Player answers.</li>
<li>Player asks: <strong>“What must I do to perform the ritual, and what do I risk breaking in the process?”</strong> GM answers. A ritual takes at least one downtime activity to perform and costs <strong>spirit</strong> on the caster according to its <strong>magnitude</strong>.  If performance of the ritual is dangerous or troublesome in some way, it requires an action roll (often <span class="game-term">Commune</span> or <span class="game-term">Calculate</span>). A ritual may also have additional costs, such as a sacrifice, rare item, the start of a dire progress clock, etc.</li>
<li>GM asks: <strong>“What belief about the past or fear for the future has knowledge of this ritual instilled in you?”</strong> Player answers.</li>
</ol>
<p>When the ritual is cast, the GM may tick a progress clock to show how much farther reality will bend before it is broken.</p>
<h3>Evocation Ritual Questions</h3>
<p>These rituals channel the energy of a powerful entity, such as a wildspirit (tawan), the ambient souls inhabiting a place or thing, an ancestor spirit in particular or a Celestial in whole, a Forge Devil, or even formidable daeva, kostlyavtsi, and fey. You might instruct local souls to search for a creature, summon a Celestial avatar to battle, unleash a Forge Devil's flames, or invoke a Lord of Spring's power to cause wild and rapid plant growth.</p>
<ol>
<li>GM asks: <strong>“What does the ritual do, and from whom or what do you draw your power?”</strong> Player answers.</li>
<li>Player asks: <strong>“What must I do to perform the ritual, and what is its price?”</strong> GM answers. A ritual takes at least one downtime activity to perform and costs <strong>spirit</strong> on the caster according to its <strong>magnitude</strong>.  If performance of the ritual is dangerous or troublesome in some way, it requires an action roll (often <span class="game-term">Commune</span>). A ritual may also have additional costs, such as a sacrifice, rare item, the start of a dire progress clock, etc.</li>
<li>GM asks: <strong>“What belief about the past or fear for the future has knowledge of this ritual instilled in you?”</strong> Player answers.</li>
</ol>
<p>When the ritual is cast, the GM may tick a progress clock to advance the agenda or approach of a malevolent entity or drain the power or favor of a benevolent one.</p>

<p>Player: “The ritual wards a place so that fey cannot find it. It’s weird because... as long as the ward is in place, the people there hear whispers in unknowable tongues.”</p>
<p>GM: “Spend a downtime action to prepare a mixture of lotus blossoms, dream smoke, and ash from a soldier who fell in battle, then scatter it in a circle about the location. You take at least 3 stress when you perform the ritual, which will be its quality for a fortune roll when it’s challenged by a spirit—so you might want to take more stress to make it more potent.”</p>
<p>Player: “Gotcha. My new fear is what will happen if the fey figure out where the ward came from and turn their vengeance on me, instead.”</p>
</blockquote>
<h2>Performing a Ritual</h2>
<p>To perform a ritual, you must have a <span class="game-term">Ritual</span> special ability, then follow the method outlined by the answers to the ritual questions. Most rituals will take <strong>one downtime activity</strong> to complete, though the GM may call for two (or more) downtime activities for very powerful or far-reaching rituals. Some rituals may be partially performed during downtime and then fully manifested at-will later by completing the last incantation or ritual action. In this case, simply make a note that the ritual has been “primed” and may be unleashed at a later time.</p>
<p>When you perform a ritual, you take an amount of <strong>stress</strong> as established by the ritual questions, according to the <strong>magnitude</strong> of the forces brought to bear. The GM uses magnitude as a <em>guideline</em> for setting the stress cost—it may be higher or lower at their discretion to better describe the nature of the ritual. Some camp selections and special abilities also reduce the stress cost for ritual casting.</p>
<p><strong>Rituals take time to cast.</strong> Use the duration examples on the magnitude table to reduce the stress cost based on the time needed, generally no less than an hour.</p>
<p>If a ritual is dangerous or troublesome to perform, make an <strong>action roll</strong> (usually <span class="game-term">Attune</span>) to see if unpleasant consequences manifest. If a ritual has an uncertain effect then a <strong>fortune roll</strong> should be made to see how well it manifests. You may spend <span class="game-term">dragonsilk</span> 2-for-1 to increase the result level of your fortune roll (this represents the expenditure of expensive or rare ritual materials). If a ritual is both dangerous and uncertain, then both rolls may be called for.</p>
<p>Each performance of a ritual is a unique event, and may not always work the same way each time. The GM or players may call for a round of questions to establish a ritual anew. Rituals are a way to bring in a wide variety of arcane effects into the game. Use with caution! If you ever go overboard, address the questions again to establish new weirdness and costs if things have gotten out of hand. These forces are not playthings and cannot be considered a reliable or safe source of power.</p></div></div>

   <div class="row"><div class="col section-title">Crafting</div></div>
   <div class="row"><div class="col section-text"><p>During downtime, a PC can <span class="game-term">Fashion</span> with special materials and tools to produce strange <strong>alchemicals</strong>, <strong>build</strong> (or <strong>modify</strong>) <strong>items</strong>, create <strong>spark-craft</strong> gadgets, or enchant <strong>arcane</strong> implements or weapons. The system for each method is similar, with different details depending on the nature of the project.</p>
<h2>Inventing</h2>
<p>To invent a formula for a new alchemical concoction or the plan for a new item of your design, you need to <span class="game-term">Calculate</span> it as a <strong>long-term project</strong>. Most new formulas or designs will require an 8-segment progress clock to invent and learn. The player and the GM answer questions about the invention to define what it will do in play and what is required to create it (see below). The player records these answers in their notes for future reference.</p>
<h3>Creation Questions</h3>
<ol>
<li>GM asks: <strong>“What type of creation is it and what does it do?”</strong> Player answers. A creation might be mundane, alchemical, arcane, or spark-craft. If a PC has an appropriate special ability (such as <span class="game-term">Alchemist</span>), they get bonuses when inventing and crafting certain creation types.</li>
<li>Player asks: <strong>“What’s the minimum quality level of this item?”</strong> GM answers, with the <strong>magnitude</strong> of the effects the item produces as a guideline.</li>
<li>GM asks: <strong>“What rare, strange, or adverse aspect of this formula or design has kept it in obscurity, out of common usage?</strong>” Player answers.</li>
<li>Player asks: <strong>“What drawbacks does this item have, if any?”</strong> GM answers by choosing one or more from the drawbacks list, or by saying there are none.</li>
</ol>
<p>A PC with the <span class="game-term">Alchemist</span> or similar special abilities invents and learns one special formula when they take the ability (they don’t have to take time to learn it).</p>
<p>Once you’ve invented a formula or design, you can <strong>craft</strong> it by using a downtime activity (see <strong>Crafting</strong>, below). No one else can craft this invention unless they learn your design as a long-term project. If you acquire a formula or design invented by someone else, you may learn to craft it by completing a long-term project.</p>
<p>Common alchemicals (such as those the Artificer begins with in their bandoliers) and ordinary items don’t require special formulas or designs to learn. Anyone may attempt to craft them by using commonly available instructions.</p>
<h2>Crafting</h2>
<blockquote>
<h4>Crafting Roll</h4>
<ul>
<li><strong>1d</strong> for each <span class="game-term">Fashion</span> action dot</li>
<li>+1 <span class="game-term">quality</span> for every 2 dragonsilk spent</li>
<li>
<p>+1 <span class="game-term">quality</span> for <span class="game-term">quality</span></p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>Critical:</strong> Quality level is Tier + 2.</p>
</li>
<li><strong>6:</strong> Quality level is Tier + 1.</li>
<li><strong>4/5:</strong> Quality level is equal to Tier.</li>
<li><strong>1-3:</strong> Quality level is Tier - 1.</li>
</ul>
</blockquote>
<p>To craft something, spend one <strong>downtime activity</strong> to make a <span class="game-term">Fashion</span> roll to determine the <strong>quality level</strong> of the item you produce. The base quality level is equal to your caravan's Tier, modified by the result of the roll.</p>
<p>The results are based on your caravan’s Tier because it indicates the overall quality of the workspace and materials you have access to.</p>
<p>The GM sets a <strong>minimum quality</strong> level that must be achieved to craft the item, based on the <strong>magnitude</strong> of the effect(s) it produces. The GM uses magnitude as a <em>guideline</em> for setting the quality level—it may be higher or lower at their discretion to better describe the nature of the project. An item may be crafted at <em>higher</em> quality if the player wishes to attempt it.</p>
<p>You may spend <span class="game-term">dragonsilk</span> 2-for-1 to increase the final quality level result of your roll (this can raise quality level beyond Tier +2).</p>
<h3>Modifying an item</h3>
<p>Adding a feature or additional function to an item is simpler than creating something new. You don’t need to invent a special formula or plan. Make a crafting roll to modify an item (the baseline quality of an item that you modify is equal to your caravan’s Tier, as usual).</p>
<ul>
<li>A simple, useful modification requires Tier + 1 quality. <em>A sword hidden within a cane.</em></li>
<li>A significant modification requires Tier + 2 quality. <em>Adding a system of pulleys to increase the accuracy and maximum range of a bow.</em></li>
<li>An arcane, spark-craft, or alchemical modification requires Tier +3 quality. <em>Weapons of thokcha and silver. A spark-craft fence which electrifies intruders. An outfit coated with chemicals to mask you from otherworldly predators.</em></li>
</ul>
<p>Modified items, like special creations, may have <strong>drawbacks</strong>.</p>
<h3>Drawbacks</h3>
<p>A creation or modification may have one or more drawbacks, chosen by the GM.</p>
<ul>
<li><span class="game-term">Complex. </span>You’ll have to create it in multiple stages; the GM will tell you how many. One downtime activity and crafting roll is needed per stage.</li>
<li><span class="game-term">Conspicuous. </span>This creation doesn’t go unnoticed. Advance a portent if it’s used any number of times on a hunt.</li>
<li><span class="game-term">Consumable.</span> This creation has a limited number of uses (all alchemicals must have this drawback, usually one use).</li>
<li><span class="game-term">Rare. </span>This creation requires a rare item or material when it is crafted.</li>
<li><span class="game-term">Unreliable. </span>When you use the item, make a fortune roll (using its <strong>quality</strong>) to see how well it performs.</li>
<li><span class="game-term">Volatile. </span>The item produces a dangerous or troublesome side-effect for the user, specified by the GM. A side-effect is a consequence, and may be <strong>resisted</strong>.</li>
</ul></div></div>
</div>



<div class="collapse container-fluid main-content no-transition " id="content---game_rules---downtime---magnitude-md----">
   <div class="row"><div class="col section-title">Magnitude</div></div>
   <div class="row"><div class="col section-text"><p>Supernatural entities and energies have a wide variety of effects and power levels. To help the GM judge these forces consistently, the <strong>magnitude</strong> scale is provided. Magnitude measures the quality level of a monster or different aspects of an arcane force: its area, scale, duration, range, and force. Whenever you need to assess an entity or power, use the magnitude scale as a guideline to judge how it compares relative to the examples given on the table.</p>
<p>You can use the magnitude of an entity or power as a dice pool for a <strong>fortune roll</strong> to see how much effect it has, if it’s not obvious or certain.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>A sea serpent summons a crushing wave toward the coast where the god-hunters are camped. How badly does this damage the caravan? Obviously it’s gonna be bad for them, but are they wet or are they washed out to sea? The GM makes a fortune roll using 4d (the magnitude of the serpent). On a <span class="game-term">1-3</span>, the wave has only little effect (for a huge wave), ruining a few supplies. On a <span class="game-term">4-5</span>, the wave has reduced effect, fully swamping the camp and injuring a few people. On a <span class="game-term">6</span>, the wave has full effect, dragging everyone and everything several yards out. On a <span class="game-term">critical</span>, the whole caravan is washed out far from shore, and all its people and beasts have a long way to swim while the serpent attempts to swallow them whole.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>You can add levels of magnitude together to describe a combination of effects, or simply focus on one key feature for the magnitude assessment, ignoring other elements, even if they’re on the magnitude scale. They’re not <em>always</em> additive.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>In the example above, the sea serpent generated magnitude 4 force and the GM included its area of effect “for free” as part of the power. A huge wave at shore should affect the entire camp, in their judgement.</p>
<p>In a different session, a Sage wants to accomplish a ritual that will unleash a hurricane across a city. The GM says that this is a very significant effect, so they add three levels of magnitude together: <em>duration 3</em>, <em>force 4</em>, and <em>area 5</em>. To create such a devastating power, the Sage will spend 12 spirit! The GM offers a compromise: the ritual will take a few hours to complete, so the stress cost will be reduced to 9, but some people in the affected area may realize what’s happening and flee before the full storm hits._</p>
</blockquote>
<p>The magnitude table is provided as a tool to help the GM make judgment calls. It’s not meant to be a rigid restriction or mathematical formula to replace those judgment calls. Use the levels as a <em>guideline</em> for setting a magnitude number that seem appropriate to you.</p>
<p>This table can also be used as a guide to <strong>quality level</strong> when a PC <strong>acquires an asset</strong> or crafts an <strong>alchemical</strong> or spark-craft <strong>gadget</strong>.</p>

    All matter is of six elements, and similarly, all change is of four directions and two guides—clockwise, counterclockwise, inward, outward, the anchor, and the choice. Spirits are ever-changing, and this drives the Algorithm.</p>
<p>The unforged soul of the daeva is lost, chaotic, directionless, meandering. It sees the bonds between souls and spirits and thinks only to break them. When it finds its way here, may the Eagle strike it down and may the Yak take it far away home.</p>
<p>The spirit of the fey is of one forged soul. It still knows only one direction, and it pushes and pushes that way no matter whom or what it crushes on the way. The fey predator's bottomless stomach hungers, and it cares not what it eats. The fey lord is ignorant of the suffering of those it exploits to satisfy its unsatisfiable greed. When it finds its way here, may the Eagle strike it down and may the Yak take it far away home.</p>
<p>The spirit of the animal is of multiple forged souls. It possesses new awareness and capabilities, but it is not anchored. The spirit of the tawan is five-souled—the four directions and the anchor, but without the choice. The spirit of the person is six-souled, full-souled. When these spirits do evil, the Eagle may strike them, but the Yak cannot carry them away, for they are already home. Thus to keep us safe we rely on the Lantern's light, the Vulture's beak and wings, and sometimes even the Monkey's crucible.

<p>Single-souled spirits who dwell in the Ring of Seasons, which lies between Earth and Stars. Fey belonging to one season are in constant conflict with their opposites until they are able to learn empathy. This allows their souls to pass into the Ring of Earth, where they clump together into the multi-souled spirits of animals, tawans, and people. Some cracks in the Wheel occasionally allow them to slip into the Ring of Earth, where they become terribly destructive. They are the most common supernatural threat.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Like many magical entities, they inflict supernatural awe and terror. Anyone without a Golden Arrow must make a fortune roll using their quality or Tier when coming in direct contact with a fey. If their quality or Tier is lower than the fey's, treat the result as one level lower (1-3 minimum).</p>
<p>NPCs with a Golden Arrow make a roll using their Tier and PCs with a Golden Arrow make a roll using their <span class="game-term">Resolve</span>. Those with a Golden Arrow also take <span class="game-term">+1 result level</span>.</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Critical:</strong> They're immune to this entity's aura for this scene.</li>
<li><strong>6:</strong> They can bite back their fear long enough to act.</li>
<li><strong>4-5:</strong> They hesitate. Their effect is reduced or they're left open for attack.</li>
<li><strong>1-3:</strong> They stand and drool or run screaming.</li>

<div class="collapse container-fluid main-content no-transition " id="content---game_rules---changelog-md----">
   <div class="row"><div class="col section-title">Changelog</div></div>
   <div class="row"><div class="col section-text"><p>This early in the game's development, changes are going to be wild and frequent, and some may go undocumented. Versioning should goes as follows: "Alpha/Beta/Release.Major.Minor"</p>
<p><strong>Alpha/Beta/Release.</strong> Alpha: feature incomplete. Beta: mostly feature complete, polishing. Release: near publication-ready.</p>
<p><strong>Major.</strong> Breaking changes or large content. Usually a public release.</p>
<p><strong>Minor.</strong> Tweaks. Usually a private release.</p>
<h2>Changelog</h2>
<h3>Alpha.1.0</h3>
<ul>
<li>
<p>"Tavan" is now "tawan". "Khalzha Khan" is now "Khalzag Khan".</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>New character sheets are here, introducing the new progression system which is intended to support longer campaign play. Various tweaks to class action ratings and items.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>You now have a single XP track and "levels". You level up when you fill your XP track, and each level gives a specific bonus, listed on the second page of each character sheet.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Sage/Priest have not been updated.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Resistance rating is no longer tied to action rating. You now get a certain number of resistance ratings to put wherever you like (replaces the old attribute-specific XP tracks).</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Abilities now have Tiers, and they are listed on the second page of the character sheet. You can only choose abilities from the same Tier as your caravan or lower. You can swap an ability when your caravan's tier goes up or when you gain a new ability.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>"Wises" replace the language mechanic. You get bonus dice to fortune rolls to recall information when your wises are relevant.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Poet now gets 1 material ✨automagically✨ at the start of downtime to fit with the new progression system. There are no longer distinct "story abilities", and previous story abilities might need their power level adjusted going forward. "Flourish" has been redone.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Training now works like this: "a character spends a downtime action training with a character that's a higher level than them, +1 XP." Therefore, you can't train if nobody in your party is higher level than you. The idea here is to help anyone who falls behind in level catch up, while also encouraging players to spend more of their downtime actions on things like long-term projects and acquiring assets.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Orrery, Training Grounds, Reliquaries, and Market caravan camp spots have been changed or temporarily removed</p>
</li>
</ul>
<p><span class="author-comment">&amp;&amp;To Yak Attack:&amp;&amp;</span></p>
<ul>
<li>
<p><span class="author-comment">&amp;&amp;Next under the gun I think are injuries/healing and the spelling of "baghatur". No changes yet, but keeping a close eye on them.&amp;&amp;</span></p>
</li>
<li>
<p><span class="author-comment">&amp;&amp;You're level 8 in the new system. Let me know if you need help figuring out how to rebuild!&amp;&amp;</span></p>
</li>
<li>
<p><span class="author-comment">&amp;&amp;Taking any and all ideas for Tier III and IV abilities! These should be zanier than lower Tier abilities.&amp;&amp;</span></p>
</li>
<li>
<p><span class="author-comment">&amp;&amp;One last thing: gonna start tracking XP more thoroughly on the "XP" tab so I can tune progression. Would really appreciate your help! If it's too annoying, we won't keep doing it.&amp;&amp;</span></p>
</li>
</ul>
<h3>Alpha.0.2</h3>
<ul>
<li>Rookie class playbook added.</li>
<li>Priest class playbook now in a playable state.</li>
<li>Sage class has some new abilities, not in playable state yet.</li>
<li>Poet's Didactic Riddle material trigger is now only once per session.</li>
<li>Warden's Evocation Ritual ability has been moved to the Priest. Open to suggestions for replacements. Maybe some kind of "Rage"?</li>
<li>Warden's unique XP trigger is now "You addressed a challenge with instinct or animal ferocity."</li>
<li>Warden's starting actions are now 1 each in Gallop, Survey, and Commune. If you're playing a Warden, keep your current ratings or adjust yours to match, your choice.</li>
<li>Mount harm now works like this: You get 1 box to start, 1 box for barding, and 1 box for the "Tough" characteristic (now called "+1 Harm").</li>
<li>All supernatural entities exude an aura of awe or terror to those who observe them directly. Previously, god-hunters were immune to this effect, while non-hunters needed to make a roll. Now, god-hunters must resist the aura or make the roll.</li>
</ul>
<p>Copied from daeva page:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Like many magical entities, they inflict supernatural awe and terror. Anyone without a Golden Arrow must make a fortune roll using their quality or Tier when coming in direct contact with a daeva. If their quality or Tier is lower than the daeva's, they take <span class="game-term">-1 result level</span> (1-3 minimum). People with a Golden Arrow take <span class="game-term">+1 result level</span>.</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Critical:</strong> They're immune to this entity's aura for this scene.</li>
<li><strong>6:</strong> They can bite back their fear long enough to act.</li>
<li><strong>4-5:</strong> They hesitate. Their effect is reduced or they're left open for attack.</li>
<li><strong>1-3:</strong> They stand and drool or run screaming.</li>
</ul>
<p>PCs may resist this aura with <span class="game-term">Resolve</span> or use special armor (if applicable) as normal. If they choose not to, they roll using the caravan's Tier.</p>
</blockquote>
<p><span class="author-comment">&amp;&amp;<strong>To Yak Attack:</strong> Overall, XP is going much faster than I would like, as Blades in the Dark's progression was tuned for short campaigns. For now, you and the caravan can earn only 1 XP per item (instead of possibly 2). Big, sweeping changes to progression (and possibly the dragonsilk economy) are probably going to happen, so brace yourselves for a "soft reset" in the future. Thanks for your understanding in dealing with my playtest crap. Anyone who wants to brainstorm with me is welcome.&amp;&amp;</span></p></div></div>

<p>A <strong>god-hunter</strong> in the present day is someone who has bound themselves to a <strong>Golden Arrow of the Sun King</strong> by taking this oath: </p>
<p><span class="author-comment">&amp;&amp;Needs work&amp;&amp;</span></p>
<blockquote>
<p>I swear on my souls</p>
<p>As I take up this arrow,</p>
<p>So I become a warrior of peace,</p>
<p>A shield to the people of the Wheel,</p>
<p>And an arrow against evil.</p>
<p>To our ancestors I give thanks,</p>
<p>To the souls of this Ring I give service,</p>
<p>And to the enemies of life I give swift and merciful death,</p>
<p>For so long as I have life to give.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Once an Arrow has be taken up, it cannot be lost, stolen, or given away. It always finds its way back to its holder, even if this would otherwise defy natural law. The Golden Arrow gives its holder resistance to the supernatural terror monsters inflict, and it allows its holder to return from life a limited number of times.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>The Dawn Queen is said to have pulled a rainbow from the sky and used it to fire a quiver of arrows through the sun, whereafter they became imbued with Heaven's power, capable of slaying the Scaled Gods. Her grandson attempted to replicate the feat with such frequency that Heaven became littered with missiles. An avatar of the Vulture appeared and made an offer to the Sun King: cease using the sun for target practice, and they will grant him and his champions leniency in death.</p>
</blockquote>
<h2>Social Role of Arrow &amp; Hunter</h2>
<p>The ways of obtaining a Golden Arrow are many, diverse, and secretive. Some hunters claim to have simply stumbled upon them. Others have been obtained by a monastery or government through secret means, and they are offered to those who have won contests, shown great courage, or--in the case of some religious groups--been trained from a young age specifically to take up the Arrow. It's been rumored that sometimes an Arrow is offered to powerful military officers and political rivals, as under the laws of most societies, god-hunters may not hold command, title, or office.</p>
<p>The Arrow grants the wielder as measure of social (and sometimes religious) authority. However, in the common view, it is taboo for god-hunters to involve themselves in political or military conflict. Rulers in power strongly encourage this narrative, citing ancient wars where god-hunters did involve themselves on all sides and mass slaughters were the result.</p>

<p><strong>The Wheel of Creation</strong> is a flat disk floating in a <strong>Void</strong> of shadowy chaos,
divided into three rings which turn about an axle. The axle is called <strong>Heaven</strong>,
where the highest of all mountains, the Throne of the Sun, rests.</p>
<p>The innermost ring, the <strong>Ring of Earth</strong>, most closely
resembles our own world. At the boundary of Heaven and Earth are
the icy <strong>Walls of Heaven</strong>, which shield the Earth from the overpowering, fiery
radiance of the Sun. Capping the Walls along one half is the
<strong>Infinite Fortress of the Moon</strong>, which garrisons Heaven's soldiers and
blocks the Sun's light at night, allowing the Wheel's inhabitants a
time of rest.</p>
<p>The next ring is called the <strong>Ring of Seasons</strong>.
Shifting islands float here, inhabited by alien creatures serving
one of four courts in an eternal battle. Its turning relative to Earth measures out
the year.</p>
<p>The outer ring is called the <strong>Ring of Stars</strong>, where mind, soul,
and body are only loosely divided. Its turning measures out the ages, and stationed there are the Celestials, amalgamations of Awakened ancestor spirits who guide and protect the people of the Wheel.</p></div></div>

were thought to have replaced yet darker powers, but their laws and demands were ignorant and

the Wheel, of its unity, its divisions, and its processes, which we know as <strong>the Algorithm</strong>. Others were awoken, and as their eyes opened, revealed to them was a world of cruel demons, driving people to hatred and violence. Some were fanged monsters, others were ghosts within their minds.</p>
<p>Determined to change this, the First Scholar and their disciples sought out the largest communities and spread their wisdom. Cooperation, perception, and strength grew among mortals. In the following years, groups of champions, now known as <strong>the God-Hunters</strong>, arose to cast down the Scaled Gods. In the end, of the Greater Nine of the Scaled Gods, two had their hearts turned, one was banished, and six were slain.</p>

<p>The Wheel and humanity are a self-sustaining evolutionary algorithm,
solving for compassion, greatness, and oneness
from the formless, useless initial state. Spirits are the Algorithm's
products. Souls are the Algorithm's parameters,
and their configuration and values change from life to life and throughout one's life.</p>
<p><strong>A spirit is an arrangement of souls.</strong> All souls have some level of power,
but unless the spirit they belong to is harmonious, that power
can't be expressed.</p>
<p>The eight constellations, or <strong><span class="tooltip-anchor" data-html=true data-toggle="tooltip" data-trigger="click "
title="The eight gods, ideas, or groups of ancestral spirits which aid Heaven in moving souls through the Algorithm.">Celestials</span></strong>, in the Ring of Stars are assigned to distill
the Void's essence into new souls and move them through the <span class="tooltip-anchor" data-html=true data-toggle="tooltip" data-trigger="click "
title="The fundamental religious concept of the peoples of the Wheel: suffering and rebirth are ubiquitous, but not aimless or endless. It is a refining process, preparing spirits ultimately to escape it.">Algorithm</span>. They are at once gods, functions, themes, and groups of Awakened ancestor spirits.
Their precise names and nature are disputed, but they are:</p>
<ul>
<li>the <strong>Deer</strong>, who tempts daeva toward the Wheel's edge.</li>
<li>the <strong>Heron</strong>, who plucks fresh daeva from the Void.</li>
<li>the <strong>Monkey</strong>, who smiths and fashions daeva into souls.</li>
<li>the <strong>Yak</strong>, who hauls material within and between the Rings.</li>
<li>the <strong>Horse</strong>, who passes messages between the Rings and Heaven.</li>
<li>the <strong>Vulture</strong>, who finds the dead and scatters their souls across the Wheel.</li>
<li>the <strong>Eagle</strong>, who destroys byproducts or corrupt souls.</li>
<li>the <strong>Lantern</strong>, who both draws spirits to Heaven and reveals their nature.</li>
</ul>
<h3>Stars &amp; Seasons</h3>
<p>A soul begins as a bundle of chaos fished from the Void. It is smithed or transmuted in
the Ring of Stars, then cast into the <span class="tooltip-anchor" data-html=true data-toggle="tooltip" data-trigger="click "
title="The middle ring of the Wheel, a land of sky islands and single-souled creatures, known as <em>fey</em>. It is divided into four quarters--one for each season. Its turning relative to the Ring of Earth has a deep effect on its environment and inhabitants.">Ring of Seasons</span>. Single-souled creatures dwell there,
called fey. Fey roughly resemble true life, like the blightcat, which
resembles a tiger, but has gills and secretes poison, or like the strange nobility of the Courts,
who might form hierarchies solely based on the length of their fingernails.</p>
<p>Most fey are aligned to the four Courts of Spring, Summer, Autumn, and Winter,
and they dedicate their lives to conflict with the opposing Court (Spring-Autumn, Summer-Winter).
A fey's soul is not initially capable of understanding the suffering of others, but as
it lives through different lives of suffering itself, it begins to gain empathy.
Souls which have learned the First Lesson, Empathy, clump together into spirits of
two or three souls, which allows them the power to pass into the Ring of Earth.</p>
<h3>Earth</h3>
<p>Spirits in the Ring of Earth with two, three, or four souls are regular animals, and
usually these souls are early on in their journey towards learning the Lessons.
A five-souled spirit is a magical animal, also called a <em>wildspirit</em> or <em>tawan</em>, like the firebird. Many are wiser or
stronger than people, but they lack consciousness, choice. Most are bound to
powerful place like a mountain, river, or forest, a group of people that share
culture and traditions, or a concept like love, study, or rebellion.</p>
<p>A six-souled spirit is a person, closest to
Awakening. The souls themselves have personalities which fluctuate,
and they are expressed variously in the spirit as the configuration of the spirit changes.
These fluctuating expressions include feelings of being male or female, of happiness,
sadness, or anger, or affinity for a person, object, place, or concept, or curiosity or disinterest.</p>
<h3>Alignment</h3>
<p>The turning of the Ring of Seasons relative to Earth changes the environment of Earth,
but also causes shifts in alignment of spirits and the aging of spirits' bodies.
The alignments of people are roughly categorized by the seasons, and they change
throughout a person's life. A person who is naive or full of hope might be seen as
spring-aligned, while a person who is modest, generous, or wistful would often be
seen as autumn-aligned.</p>
<p>Similarly, the turning of the Ring of Stars shifts alignments, but in families, clans, or groups of friends. An individual's expression of this alignment is often related by others to one of the Celestials. People aligned with the Deer might be described as swift, beautiful, or free. Some might be considered to be aligned with the Lantern because they guide the way or reveal the nature of others.</p>
<h3>Death and Final States</h3>
<p>When an animal or person dies, the Vulture comes to tear apart the spirit and scatter
its souls across the Ring of Earth, where they will gather with other souls at the birth of
a new creature to form its spirit.</p>
<p>Eventually a spirit of six-souls might attain a configuration from which it can neither be shifted
by the seasons or torn apart by the Vulture. At this point, it is brought to the Lantern,
which reveals it as either Awakened or otherwise. Awakened spirits are said to either be
brought into Heaven or sent to the Ring of Stars to join the work of the Celestials.
Other final states are more rare, usually occurring when a person has lived a life of evil
 and has lost the ability to feel remorse for their actions or empathy for others. This typically
 results in the spirit being to the Monkey's forge, <em>Hell</em>. There the spirit is melted down to be recast into new souls.</p>

    It was still cold in the cave, but at least there was no wind. Grandpa held the mug to the fire a moment, trying to warm it back up. Snezhana patiently waited for him to continue. He wanted to speak Tizbeki with her, even though he wasn’t very good at it. He looked very serious. She guessed he was trying to think of the right words. She smiled.-->

<!--"The Algorithm, it is like a complex machine. You’ve seen some, myshka, like that Dragon Clan wizard’s grain-grinder. Has lots of gears. Runs on lightning. Boom!" he said, opening his eyes wide and spreading his free hand dramatically. She jumped a little, giggling. -->

<!--"The Old Gods were like rocks—well, it was like they put rocks in the gears. Old Gods are like snakes and such, but to them we were ants." Grandpa held up two fingers close together. "Too small to move the rocks, huh, Snezhka?" She nodded. "But the First Scholar and the God-Hunters brought many ants together. They got some snakes to help us and scared away the rest, then we all pushed the rocks out."-->

<!--She picked up the small, golden arrow at Grandpa’s feet, two black feathers at its end. "With these?" she asked. -->

<!--He chuckled. "Well, sort of."

<p>In the time of the First Scholar, mortals were universally under the rule of the Scaled Gods:
the Great Nine and the Lesser Ninety, aided by demonic daeva allowed to flood the Wheel. The Great Nine are:</p>

<li><strong>Sanrakshaka, the Guardian</strong> <span class="author-comment">&amp;&amp;Mucalinda analogue. Needs renaming to something that isn't Sanskrit.&amp;&amp;</span></li>

</ul>
<p><span class="author-comment">&amp;&amp;Rest will expand on enemies/how the Algorithm has struggled or failed, speculation on why the Scaled Gods came about in the first place. Possibly include description of troubles fey, daeva, and skaryid can cause.&amp;&amp;</span></p>
<h3>The Architect</h3>
<p>While most are unsure whether the Algorithm will terminate, those that hold faith in the Architect believe otherwise.</p>
<p><span class="author-comment">&amp;&amp;Discuss the concept of the Architect here (if we keep it). The idea of a being who set the Algorithm and the Wheel in motion introduces some ideas of monotheism or pantheons with a supreme figure that should hopefully gives room to work in concepts inspired by things like Rod, Perun, Ahura Mazda, the Jade Emperor, etc. The idea of Tengri or the Jade Emperor is possibly closer to worship of Heaven or the Sun (in our context) maybe, but might also fit here.&amp;&amp;</span></p>
<h3>The Steward</h3>
<p><span class="author-comment">&amp;&amp;the Steward is another view of the Architect that the velniki of Sanctum hold, and it is a possible way to explore Abrahamic (probably mostly Islamic and Christian) concepts that differ from Zoroastrianism (although I am finding that really they are quite similar)&amp;&amp;</span></p></div></div>

<h3>Abshast Basin</h3>
<p>The western edge of the Azad Empire, where Tizbeki and Azad culture intermix. Mostly steppe, with the <strong>Mirelands</strong> to the north, where the people of the swamps, while technically under the Liberator's banner, do their best to avoid imperial interference. Of particular note is the town of <strong>Five Waters</strong> in the center of the basin, which has skyrocketed in population and begun constructing walls and garrisons, solidifying the Empire's strength in the area.</p>
<h3>Eastern Azad</h3>
<p>A patchwork of mountains, hills, and plains. The fertile and sheltered <strong>Margzak Valley</strong> in the northeast is the Azad Empire's largest source of grain. <strong>Sokhili Azad</strong>, along the eastern coast, is the world's only republic, free from the Empire. Though Sokhili goods are found throughout the world, it's a mystery to most how exactly they manage to trade so far and so wide with the Empire constantly at their throat. It's rumored that Sokhili merchants make use of the Parvoz desert to skirt the Empire's control over the roads, or occasionally make mad dashes across the Gold Gulf to trade with Prav, dodging sea serpents all the while. <strong>Sarkashabad</strong> is a hilly pastoral grassland under no unified government, resisting both Empire and Republic.</p>

<h3>Ephemeral Wastes</h3>
<p>An enormous, scorching desert known for its colorful sky and countless tricks and illusions which circles the outer edge of the Ring of Earth. No plantlife or creatures are known to survive here. The four <strong>Great Gates</strong> dot the border between worlds, allowing passage from the Ring of Seasons to empathetic souls. Occasionally they have failed or been tampered with, causing tides of fey monsters and armies to sweep into the world. The Empire has stationed a massive garrison near the land bridge to the Wastes, and it's relied on sea serpents to guard the rest of the world against future invasions.</p>
<h3>Eternal Forests</h3>
<p>A sparsely-populated jungle closed off by high mountains and serpent-filled sea. The area has become a pilgrimage site since, and monks tirelessly work here to preserve the conditions that led to the First Scholar's birth and Awakening here. The consumption of any meat and destruction of any trees is forbidden here, as are weapons and large groups of travelers--though pilgrims in smaller numbers are welcomed. The Riyulan kingdoms and clans in the north take pride in guarding the northern mountain passes, while the Vulture Clans to the east are said to forbid all passage. Wardens are trained to protect the land and its spirits, and many are granted the Golden Arrow in order to better fight off supernatural threats.</p>
<h3>Frozen Sea</h3>
<h3>Simmering Gulf</h3>
<p>A large and very shallow body of water. Like all others, it's plagued by voracious sea serpents.</p>
<h3>Tizbeki Desert</h3>
<p>The Ring of Earth's largest desert. It includes several oasis cities, which form a major part of the Chain, or Tizbek, of water sources which support travel from Talbara, Riyul, and Lei to Prav and Azad.</p>
<p><span class="author-comment"><span class="author-comment">&amp;&amp;expand&amp;&amp;</span></span></p>
<h3>Tizbeki Steppe</h3>
<h3>Sanctum</h3>
<p><span class="author-comment">&amp;&amp;Velniki temple city within an icy crater-lake&amp;&amp;</span></p>
<h3>Talbaran Riverlands</h3>
<p>A rich land which sits at the heart of the Dragon Clan Khaganate, supporting a mix of settlements in the south and nomads in the north. <span class="author-comment"><span class="author-comment">&amp;&amp;expand&amp;&amp;</span></span></p>
<h3>Galyn Sea</h3>
<p>Named after Galyn Aral, an enormous underwater volcano complex which warms otherwise frigid waters for miles around, allowing the many fishing villages of Clan Shuur to prosper.</p>
<h3>Outer Prav</h3>
<p>Includes <strong>Vozhestgrad</strong>, a large city which sits within a carving of an enormous serpent's mouth. <span class="author-comment">&amp;&amp;This is sort of our Doskvol. It's dark, filled with cults and gangs and a large, desperate, and oppressive police force and justice system.&amp;&amp;</span> <strong>Bogia</strong> is Vozhestgrad's countryside, a land once caught between the Willow King and Mednista.</p>

<p>Riyul is a secluded land in two parts: an expansive mountain-ringed plateau in the north, and a sacred tropical rainforest in the south, the Eternal Forests. Many Riyulans live as semi-nomadic shepherds, and outsiders often speak of them as a very strong people for the harsh climates they endure and the fey incursions they must constantly fight off in the south. Riyul is known as the birthplace of the First Scholar.</p></div></div>

<p>In the center and northwest of the Ring of Earth is Talbara, a land dominated by steppe, interrupted by mountains. The majority of Talbarans are nomadic, and the populations of Talbaran cities are always shifting as fortunes and rulers change with the turning of the Seasons. In the north are the Wolf Clans, who claim close lineage to Khaalzha Khan. It is said that when Khaalzha Khan died, his treasures and lands were given to his nine children (this included a few close non-relatives) who would found clans of their own. There are in the current day approximately fifteen clans which claim this inheritance. A few are listed below:</p>

Considering leaning them more towards Tibetan nyen or tsen, though as far as I understand it nyen and tsen are considered almost universally malevolent. "Velnik" is an in-setting Pravyan exonym&amp;&amp;</span></p>
<p>A small population of giant mountain-dwellers. Each velnik stands from seven to over eight feet tall, possesses towering horns or antlers, and is covered in thick fur. Their skin ranges in shade from obsidian black to marble white, and their hair is usually in shades of brown or gray. Velniki are the slowest reproducing and longest-lived species, feeling no physical effects from aging, though their culture of courage usually leads most to their death well before the age of two-hundred.</p>
<p>The largest population of velniki in this age resides in the mountains around Sanctum, a temple-city which floats on an icy crater lake. Velniki are the chief believers in the the Steward, the Architect of the Algorithm as an eternal, observing figure, who occasionally intervenes directly. The Steward is often fit into the framework of the common human religion by both velniki and humans, though practices around them differ greatly.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Before Sanctum was Sanctum, several Pravyan and Talbaran clans were long at war with the local velnik king, Nasserik, who had led raiders astride mammoths against them for over a century. At the Council of One-Hundred Chieftains, they made an alliance to destroy him, and they nearly succeeded. </p>
<p>As they pushed the last velnik warriors up the slope of a mountain, the king knelt down and prayed to any power that would listen—and surprisingly, something answered the following dawn. A star came crashing down on the mountain, obliterating its summit and sending avalanches down all sides. Miraculously, the velnik forces were largely unharmed, while the Pravyan and Talbaran armies were all but destroyed.</p>
<p>King Nasserik rededicated his people to the Steward, and they constructed a temple-city in the frozen crater the comet left behind. He is said to have abdicated to his daughter before diving into the lake's waters some years later, and he hasn't been found in the centuries since.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Mainstream velnik culture encourages them to become daring adventurers, fighting in battles and collecting stories across the Ring. Once every dozen years or so, they shed their horns and antlers, signaling that it's time to journey home to Sanctum and share their tales before the Steward's Altar. These shed antlers become symbols of times past and tokens of trust and friendship, and the growth of new ones accompanies growth in a velnik's character.</p>
<p>Not all velniki call Sanctum home, either because they were raised in other communities or they reject their kin's piety and pursuits. Some practice old ways and follow old religions, and others adopt the common beliefs of humans. Though few in number, they can be found in all places and occupations across the Ring.</p></div></div>

   <div class="row"><div class="col section-title">Factions Overview</div></div>
   <div class="row"><div class="col section-text"><h2>States &amp; Cities</h2>
<h3>The Liberator, Azadi Empress (Tier IV)</h3>
<p>The Liberator rules her Empire from Zinvehir, the City of Endless Steps, and the largest settlement known to humanity. She's famed for her wisdom and casual nature, but feared for her ambition. The Azad Empire traditionally values freedom, and its laws heavily restrict the Liberator's direct power. Nonetheless, she's been able to delicately maneuver ministers, priests, and generals to expand her authority the Empire's borders a great deal until recently.</p>
<h5>Faction Clocks</h5>
<ul>
<li><strong>12</strong> Restore the old temples of Zinvehir City</li>
<li><strong>8</strong> Establish an alliance with one of the Cinder Clans</li>
</ul>
<h3>Prince of Vozhestgrad (Tier IV)</h3>
<p>The second-largest city on this Ring, Vozhestgrad is dark, bustling, and dangerous, and this is reflected in its quick-tempered, brooding prince. The Prince holds a good deal of popularity in Bogia outside the city and little within, and many say if the cults and gangs constantly threatening Vozhestgrad didn't take up so much of his attention, Prav would have already crowned its first king.</p>
<h5>Faction Clocks</h5>
<ul>
<li><strong>10</strong></li>
</ul>
<h3>Council of Mount Tsuglin (Tier IV)</h3>
<p><span class="author-comment">&amp;&amp;todo: Update other faction descriptions to this format.&amp;&amp;</span></p>
<p>Rulers of the Dragon Clan Khaganate, one of the Ring of Earth's most powerful states. A heterogeneous group of nobles, commanders, and sparkcraft engineers.</p>
<p>The council have transformed the traditional Talbaran meeting place of Mount Tsuglin into a maze of fortifications, workshops, and offices over the last few decades. They are de facto controlled by <strong>Sar Khanum</strong>, whose direct ancestors formed the Dragon Clan from Clan Khash and surviving Leitians. The Khanum has adapted technology both ancient and modern from the Lei Empire as a means for conquest of other Talbaran groups, ever expanding the Khaganate. Other notable members of the council include <strong>Mergen Khan</strong> of the Mirror Clan, who desires to expand his territory eastward, and several officers and advisers descended from Leitians who were outside of the Lei Empire at the time it was destroyed, many of whom seek to reclaim their homeland from the machines that plague it. <strong>General Qara Yongtai</strong>, who oversees construction of fortifications in the south, and <strong>General Ban Yi</strong>, who leads scouts on missions deep into Lei, are prominent members of this group.</p>
<p><span class="author-comment">&amp;&amp;description of Qara Yongtai and Ban Yi should probably move to Dragon Clan Khaganate Army&amp;&amp;</span></p>
<h5>Faction Clocks</h5>
<ul>
<li><strong>8</strong> Bring Clan Shuur into the Khaganate</li>
<li><strong>12</strong> Conquer Astabatya</li>
<li><strong>10</strong> Establish an outpost in Lifespring Basin</li>
</ul>

<p>A rebel faction in Five Waters, seeking to</p>
<h2>Militaries &amp; Gangs</h2>
<h3>Azad Imperial Army (Tier V)</h3>
<h3>Dragon Clan Khaganate Army (Tier V)</h3>
<h3>Tuguai Horde (Tier V)</h3>
<p>An army of ancient machines thought to have been left unfinished by the First Empress and Lei Long. They now guard the Lei Empire's ruins and are occasionally seen outside its walls. While they'll attack anyone they encounter, they seem to focus on hunting users of magic in particular.</p>
<h3>Band Beneath the Moon Banner (Tier III)</h3>
<p>A mercenary company, widely condemned for their use of former god-hunters as assassins.</p>
<h3>Simir League (Tier III)</h3>
<p>At its formation, the Azad Empire found itself lacking in god-hunters. The Simir League was formed as an extension to the Imperial Army, becoming their experts on dealing with supernatural threats. Though they do not have Golden Arrows to aid them in direct conflict against fey, daeva, and the like, they have learned to deal with monsters by overwhelming numbers and preventative measures, usually acting as advisers to the Army. Many Azadi god-hunters have been chosen from the Simir League's ranks.</p>
<h2>Orders</h2>
<h3>Eternal Forests (Tier III)</h3>
<h3>The Pure Fire (Tier III)</h3>
<p>The Celestials are honored and the Algorithm is understood by many means, and the elemental priesthoods have become especially popular of late in Azad's heartland. Chief among them is the Pure Fire, who evoke the imagery of the Empire's ancient rulers, the Firelords. They are notably displeased with the Liberator's orders to restore the temples of the other priesthoods in Zinvehir.</p>
<h3>The Glacier's Melt (Tier II)</h3>
<p>A smaller elemental priesthood, which</p>
<h3>Keepers (Tier II)</h3>
<p>A group of Far Traveler warriors were once pursued across the stars by a creature so foul they dare not repeat its name. They eventually came to the Ring of Earth, where they trapped the entity in the Chasm of Notha. A thousand years later, the Keepers represent those Travelers who have kept watch at the Chasm. They are possess strange and powerful technology, though much of it has fallen into disrepair over the long years.</p>
<h3>Siphons (Tier II)</h3>
<p>A splinter faction of the Keepers which has gained increasing control at the Chasm of Notha. Rather than maintain the eternal watch, they've sought ways to harness power from the entity trapped there. Violence between the Keepers and Siphons has so far been kept to a minimum, though tensions continue to rise.</p>
<h3>Harbingers (?)</h3>
<p>A faction at the Chasm of Notha which the others speak of only in concerned whispers, for who would dare suggest that the evil there so long guarded should be let loose upon the world?</p>
<h2>Clans</h2>
<h3>Dragon Clan</h3>
<h3>Mirror Clan</h3>
<p>The most powerful Talbaran clan which claims no ties to Khalzag Khan, led by Mergen Khan, a notoriously ambitious man who many deride for his lack of martial skill. The clan has a large settlement at Mirror Lake, an unnaturally still body of freshwater in the eastern Talbaran Riverlands. They have recently become vassal of the Dragon Clan, and the rulers of the Tizbeki Desert's city-states fear that the Mergen Khan will convince the Council of Mt. Tsuglin to push their armies eastward.</p>
<h3>Rainbow Clans</h3>
<p>Disparate groups of nomads in the east of the Riyulan Plateau, named so for the many colors with which they paint their faces and known for their pride in protecting mountain passes to the Eternal Forests. The western Kingdoms of Riyul</p>
<h3>Leopard Clans</h3>
<h3>Silent Clans</h3>
<h3>Vulture Clans</h3>
<h3>Wolf Clans</h3>
<p><span class="author-comment">&amp;&amp;Clans of the Talbaran Steppe and surrounding forests and mountains, most of which claim ancestry through one of Khalzag Khan's children. Not a unified faction unto themselves, includes Clan Temur, Clan Shuur, Clan Khuurel, etc.&amp;&amp;</span></p>
<h3>Clan Temur</h3>
<p>The Iron Clan, one of the Wolf Clans. They claim ancestry from Khalzag Khan's firstborn daughter, and they are depicted as the most fearsome of Talbara's warriors in legend and song. Their position among the other Wolf Clans is tenuous now, owing to their long history of attempts at reforming Khalzag Khan's empire with them at the top.</p>
