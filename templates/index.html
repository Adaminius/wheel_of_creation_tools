            <p>The Wheel of Creation is a third-party setting and rules supplement for the 5th Edition Open Gaming
              License. It
              portrays a world of grassy steppe, oasis cities, icy forests, and caravans which travel across it and to
              worlds
              beyond. Players play as <em>god-hunters</em>, groups of adventurers who guide, protect, and fuel these
              caravans for
              wealth, renown, and the safety and prosperity of the world.</p>

            <h3 id="theproducts">The Products</h3>

            <p>The current plan is that there will be three products associated with the first release of the Wheel of
              Creation.</p>

            <ol>
              <li>A free PDF which contains caravaning and monster creation rules, a brief introduction to the setting,
                a
                subset of
                additional race, class, and background options, and a handful of pre-written caravan destinations within
                the Wheel
                of Creation setting.
              </li>

              <li>A paid PDF with additional art, additional race and class options, full item creation rules, and
                additional
                setting description and pre-written caravan destinations.
              </li>

              <li>A free web companion tool for monster creation, currently in development at <a
                  href="/monster">wheelofcreation.net/monster</a>, and potentially other web tools as they are
                developed.
              </li>
            </ol>
          </div>
          <div class="tab-pane fade" id="rules" role="tabpanel" aria-labelledby="rules-tab">
            <p>The flow of gameplay in the Wheel of Creation assumes a specific structure of Expeditions, each of which
              are expected
              to take aobut 4-6 game sessions: </p>

            <ul>
              <li>Players choose a destination and decide the initial composition of the caravan under their shared
                protection.
              </li>

              <li>The GM decides what places and obstacles they will encounter along the way.</li>

              <li>Throughout the Expedition, players use their skills and connections to learn more about what lies
                ahead
                and
                prepare accordingly.
              </li>

              <li>Among other challenges, the caravan will be faced with monster raids, and the players will need to
                protect the
                caravan.
              </li>

              <li>At times, the caravan will be unable to progress until the seasons turn or the players may decide to
                halt of their
                own accord. They can use this time to trade, gather information, craft items, and explore the area in
                search for
                specific monsters.
              </li>

              <li>At the end of the Expedition, the players are rewarded according to how well their caravan fared and
                what
                treasures they were able to gather along the way.
              </li>

              <li>The players choose a new destination.</li>
            </ul>

            <p>There are systems for generating monsters randomly (or not) using a system of tags, creating creatures
              which are
              fresh for both the players and GM. The players will need to consult with locals and experts, dig through
              dusty
              scrolls, and use their skills and magical abilities to determine the capabilities, behaviors, and
              weaknesses
              of these
              monsters in order to defeat them. A system for creating magical items using treasures and parts looted
              from
              these
              monsters will also be provided.</p>

          <div class="tab-pane fade" id="setting" role="tabpanel" aria-labelledby="setting-tab">
            <p>The Wheel is a flat disk floating in a void of shadowy chaos, divided into three rings which turn about
              an
              axle. The
              axle is called <strong>Heaven</strong>, where sits the Celestial Throne. </p>

            <p>The innermost ring is called the <strong>Ring of Earth</strong>, which most closely resembles our own
              world. The next
              ring is called the <strong>Ring of Seasons</strong>, where float shifting islands inhabited by alien
              creatures, most
              serving one of four Seasonal Courts. Its turning relative to Earth measures out the year. The outer ring
              is
              called the
              <strong>Ring of Stars</strong>, where mind, soul, and body are undivided. Its turning measures out the
              ages,
              and there
              Heaven stations its most trusted champions to repel the <strong>Void</strong>.</p>

            <p>Most of the Ring of Earth belongs to one great landmass, and sea travel is limited by brutal storms and
              malevolent
              sea serpents. To the far north are the Glistening Walls of Heaven, which sit at the end of a great expanse
              of ice. At
              the southern end of the world are the Ephemeral Wastes, an enormous, scorching desert which is dotted with
              the Ring of
              Earth's largest gateways to the Ring of Seasons.</p>

            <h4 id="humanandothercultures">Human and Other Cultures</h4>

            <p>There are four human supercultures on the primary landmass of Ring of Earth. <strong>Talbarans</strong>
              are
              primarily
              nomadic
              shepherds which inhabit the great steppe at the Ring of Earth's center. <strong>Pravyans</strong> survive
              as
              farmers
              and hunters in the frozen forests of the northeast. <strong>Riyulans</strong> dwell in the mountainous
              region in the
              south, divided into a brutal desert, expansive plateau, and an isolated jungle. In the hilly grasslands to
              the
              southeast is the <strong>Azadan</strong> Empire, which controls the only land route to the Wastes.
              Formerly,
              the
              Empire of Lei occupied the southwest, now there lies a haunted ruin.</p>

            <p><strong>Elves</strong> are a people displaced, formerly psionic warriors from the Ring of Stars. Their
              forms are
              naturally malleable, and they have quickly adapted to life in the Ring of Seasons and Ring of Earth.
              <strong>Dwarves</strong> are beings blessed by and in service to the elements, who dwell throughout Earth.
              <strong>Blins</strong>,
              including goblins and gnomes, are outcasts of the Courts of the Ring of Seasons.
              <strong>Scaleborn</strong>,
              including
              naga and dragonborn, are the descendants of the Scaled Gods, who were first to rule over the Earth.
              <strong>Velniki</strong> are horned giants renowned for their strength and unwavering faith in Heaven,
              dwelling in the
              mountains between Talbara and Prav. <strong>Daevakin</strong>, or tieflings, are the offspring of humans
              and
              wicked
              demons which inhabit the spaces between the Rings, cursed with horns, fangs, and tails and universally
              distrusted.</p>

            <h4 id="monsters">Monsters</h4>

            <p><strong>Fey</strong> are creatures from the Ring of Seasons, many of which serve the Courts of Spring,
              Summer,
              Autumn, and Winter. Each has supernatural abilities and alien desires. <strong>Kostlyavtsi</strong> are
              intelligent
              undead humans wielding foul sorceries and collectively working towards some unknown purpose. </p>

            <p><strong>Tuguai</strong> are decaying constructs of terra cotta and stone, animated by clockwork and magic
              and built
              to hunt spellcasters. <strong>Daevas</strong> are manifestations of evil which drive mortals to
              destruction,
              feeding
              on their anger, sorrow, hatred, and, ultimately, their souls. <strong>Skaryid</strong> are inhabitants of
              the Ring of
              Stars whose minds are their bodies, corrupted by the Void.</p>
