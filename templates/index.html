              <p>The Wheel of Creation is a third-party setting, rules supplement, and collection of web apps
                for the 5th Edition Open Game
                License. It portrays a world of grassy steppe, oasis cities, icy forests, and caravans which travel
                across it and to worlds beyond. Players play as <em>God-Hunters</em>, groups of adventurers who guide
                these caravans through the monster-filled wilds.</p>
              <h3>The Products</h3>
              <p>The current plan is that there will be three products associated with the first release of the Wheel of
                Creation.</p>
              <ol>
                <li>
                  A free PDF and web page which contains caravanning and monster creation rules, an introduction to
                    the setting, a subset of additional race, class, and background options, and a handful of
                    pre-written caravan destinations within the Wheel of Creation setting.
                </li>
                <li>
                  A paid PDF with additional art, additional race and class options, full item creation rules, and
                    additional setting description and pre-written caravan destinations.
                </li>
                <li>
                  Web companion apps, including:
                  <ul>
                    <li>
                      <strong>The Monster Builder</strong>, currently in development at <a
                          href="https://wheelofcreation.net/monster">wheelofcreation.net/monster</a>. This tool helps you
                        quickly generate and scale the difficulty of monsters that fit the WoC setting, and it provides
                        a list of harvestable components for each to be used in the Item Crafter. It's nearly feature
                        complete, and the current focus is on adding content, ironing out bugs, and adjusting game
                        balance.
                    </li>
                    <li>
                      The <strong>Caravan Builder</strong>, a system for itinerant adventuring. First version just
                        released at <a href="https://wheelofcreation.net/caravan_app">wheelofcreation.net/caravan_app</a>!
                    </li>
                    <li>
                      The <strong>Item Crafter</strong>, still early in development.
                    </li>
                  </ul>
                </li>
              </ol>
            </div>
            <div aria-labelledby="rules-tab" class="tab-pane fade" id="rules" role="tabpanel">
              <p>The Wheel of Creation is designed for compatibility with the 5th Edition SRD, with a few
                adjustments:</p>
              <ul>
                <li>PCs usually don't need to worry about small-scale (&lt;50gp) purchases or managing their personal
                  encumbrance.
                </li>
                <li>Many mechanics occur on the scale of weeks, so long rests take one week, and short rests take eight
                  hours.
                </li>
                <li>Alignment, language, and experience are different.</li>
              </ul>
              <p>In addition, the intended flow of gameplay is a specific structure of Expeditions, each of which are
                expected to take
                about 6 game sessions and take a few months of in-game time:</p>
              <ul>
                <li>
                  <p>Players choose a destination and decide the initial composition of the caravan under their shared
                    protection.</p>
                </li>
                <li>
                  <p>The GM decides what places and obstacles they will encounter along the way, aided by systems and
                    tables provided
                    in the caravan rules.</p>
                </li>
                <li>
                  <p>Throughout the Expedition, players use their skills and connections to learn more about what lies
                    ahead and
                    prepare accordingly.</p>
                </li>
                <li>
                  <p>Among other hazards, the caravan will be faced with monster raids, bandit attacks, harsh weather,
                    and distances
                    that drain the caravan's supplies. The players must support the caravan, and the caravan supports
                    them.</p>
                </li>
                <li>
                  <p>At times, the caravan will be unable to progress until the seasons turn or the players may decide
                    to halt of
                    their own accord. They can use this time to solve problems for the locals, trade, gather
                    information, craft items,
                    and explore the area in search for specific monsters.</p>
                </li>
                <li>
                  <p>At the end of the Expedition, the players are rewarded according to how well their caravan fared
                    and what
                    treasures they were able to gather along the way.</p>
                </li>
                <li>
                  <p>The players choose a new destination.</p>
                </li>
              </ul>
              <p>There are systems for generating monsters randomly (or not) using a system of tags, creating creatures
                which are
                fresh for both the players and GM. The players will need to consult with locals and experts, dig through
                dusty
                scrolls, and use their skills and magical abilities to determine the capabilities, behaviors, and
                weaknesses of these
                monsters in order to defeat them. A system for creating magical items using treasures and parts looted
                from these
                monsters will also be provided.</p>
            </div>
            <div aria-labelledby="setting-tab" class="tab-pane fade" id="setting" role="tabpanel">
              <p>The Wheel is a flat disk floating in a Void of shadowy chaos, divided into three rings which turn about
                an axle. The
                axle is called Heaven, where sits the Throne of the Sun.</p>
              <p>The innermost ring is called the <strong>Ring of Earth</strong>, which most closely resembles our own
                world. At the
                boundary of Heaven and Earth are the icy Walls of Heaven, which shield the Earth from the overpowering,
                fiery radiance
                of the Sun. Capping the Walls along one half is the Infinite Fortress of the Moon, which guards the path
                to Heaven and
                blocks the Sun's light at night, allowing the Wheel's inhabitants a time of rest. Nearly all of the Ring
                of Earth
                belongs to one great landmass, and sea travel is limited by brutal storms and malevolent sea serpents.
                At the southern
                end of the world are the Ephemeral Wastes, an enormous, scorching desert which is dotted with the Ring
                of Earth's
                largest gateways to the Ring of Seasons.</p>
              <p>The <strong>Ring of Seasons</strong> is a place of floating, shifting islands inhabited by alien
                creatures, most
                serving one of four Seasonal Courts. Its turning relative to Earth measures out the year.</p>
              <p>The outermost ring is called the <strong>Ring of Stars</strong>, where mind, soul, and body are
                undivided. Its
                turning measures out the ages, and there Heaven stations its most trusted champions against the Void,
                the Celestials.
              </p>
              <h4>Human and Other Cultures</h4>
              <p>There are five human supercultures in the Wheel of Creation. <strong>Talbarans</strong> are primarily
                nomads which
                inhabit the coast and great steppe in the Ring of Earth's west. <strong>Pravyans</strong> survive as
                farmers and
                hunters in the frozen forests of the northeast. <strong>Riyulans</strong> dwell in the mountainous
                region in the
                south, divided into a expansive plateau and an isolated jungle. Near the Ring of Earth's center are the
                <strong>Tizbekians</strong>,
                whose city-states and pastures span an enormous desert. In the hilly grasslands to the southeast is the
                <strong>Azadan</strong> Empire, which controls the only land route to the Wastes. Formerly, the Lei
                Empire occupied
                the southwest, but now there are only haunted ruins.</p>
              <p><strong>Elves</strong> are a people displaced, formerly psionic warriors from the Ring of Stars. Their
                forms are
                naturally malleable, and they have quickly adapted to life in the Ring of Seasons and Ring of Earth.
                <strong>Dwarves</strong> are beings blessed by and in service to the elements, who dwell throughout
                Earth. <strong>Blins</strong>,
                including goblins and gnomes, are outcasts of the Courts of the Ring of Seasons.
                <strong>Scaleborn</strong>, including
                naga and dragonborn, are the descendants of the Scaled Gods, who were first to rule over the Earth.
                <strong>Velniki</strong> are giants renowned for their strength and unwavering faith in the Steward,
                dwelling in the
                mountains between Talbara and Prav.</p>
              <h4>Monsters</h4>
              <p><strong>Fey</strong> are creatures from the Ring of Seasons, many of which serve the Courts of Spring,
                Summer,
                Autumn, and Winter. Each has supernatural abilities and alien desires. <strong>Kostlyavtsi</strong> are
                intelligent
                undead humans wielding foul sorceries and collectively working towards some unknown purpose. </p>
              <p><strong>Tuguai</strong> are decaying constructs of terra cotta and stone, animated by clockwork and
                magic and built
                to hunt spellcasters. <strong>Daevas</strong> are manifestations of evil which drive mortals to
                destruction, feeding
                on their anger, sorrow, hatred, and, ultimately, their souls. <strong>Skaryid</strong> are inhabitants
                of the Ring of
                Stars whose minds are their bodies, corrupted by the Void.</p>
