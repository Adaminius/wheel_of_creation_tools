<h2>Overview</h2>
<p>The Wheel of Creation is a third-party setting and rules supplement for the 5th Edition Open Gaming License. It
  portrays a world of grassy steppe, oasis cities, icy forests, and caravans which travel across it and to worlds
  beyond. Players play as <em>God-Hunters</em>, groups of adventurers who guide, protect, and fuel these caravans for
  wealth, renown, and the safety and prosperity of the world.</p>
<h3>The Products</h3>
<p>The current plan is that there will be three products associated with the first release of the Wheel of Creation.</p>
<ol>
  <li>
    <p>A free PDF and web page which contains caravanning and monster creation rules, an introduction to the setting, a
      subset of additional race, class, and background options, and a handful of pre-written caravan destinations within
      the Wheel of Creation setting.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>A paid PDF with additional art, additional race and class options, full item creation rules, and additional
      setting description and pre-written caravan destinations.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Web companion apps, including:</p>
    <ul>
      <li>
        <p><strong>The Monster Builder</strong>, currently in development at <a href="https://wheelofcreation.net/monster">wheelofcreation.net/monster</a>.
          This tool helps you quickly generate and scale the difficulty of monsters that fit the WoC setting, and it
          provides a list of harvestable components for each to be used in the Item Crafter. It's nearly feature
          complete, and the current focus is on adding content, ironing out bugs, and adjusting game balance.</p>
      </li>
      <li>
        <p>The <strong>Caravan Builder</strong>, a system for itinerant adventuring. First version just released at <a
            href="https://wheelofcreation.net/caravan_app">wheelofcreation.net/caravan_app</a>!</p>
      </li>
      <li>
        <p>The <strong>Item Crafter</strong>, still early in development.</p>
      </li>
    </ul>
  </li>
</ol>
<h2>Rules and Gameplay</h2>
<p>The Wheel of Creation is designed for compatibility with the 5th Edition SRD, with a few adjustments:</p>
<ul>
  <li>PCs usually don't need to worry about small-scale (&lt;50gp) purchases or managing their personal encumbrance.
  </li>
  <li>Many mechanics occur on the scale of weeks, so long rests take one week, and short rests take eight hours.</li>
  <li>Alignment, language, and experience are different.</li>
</ul>
<p>In addition, the intended flow of gameplay is a specific structure of Expeditions, each of which are expected to take
  about 6 game sessions and take a few months of in-game time:</p>
<ul>
  <li>
    <p>Players choose a destination and decide the initial composition of the caravan under their shared protection.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The GM decides what places and obstacles they will encounter along the way, aided by systems and tables provided
      in the caravan rules.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Throughout the Expedition, players use their skills and connections to learn more about what lies ahead and
      prepare accordingly.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Among other hazards, the caravan will be faced with monster raids, bandit attacks, harsh weather, and distances
      that drain the caravan's supplies. The players must support the caravan, and the caravan supports them.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>At times, the caravan will be unable to progress until the seasons turn or the players may decide to halt of
      their own accord. They can use this time to solve problems for the locals, trade, gather information, craft items,
      and explore the area in search for specific monsters.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>At the end of the Expedition, the players are rewarded according to how well their caravan fared and what
      treasures they were able to gather along the way.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The players choose a new destination.</p>
  </li>
</ul>
<p>There are systems for generating monsters randomly (or not) using a system of tags, creating creatures which are
  fresh for both the players and GM. The players will need to consult with locals and experts, dig through dusty
  scrolls, and use their skills and magical abilities to determine the capabilities, behaviors, and weaknesses of these
  monsters in order to defeat them. A system for creating magical items using treasures and parts looted from these
  monsters will also be provided.</p>
<h2>The Setting</h2>
<p>The Wheel is a flat disk floating in a Void of shadowy chaos, divided into three rings which turn about an axle. The
  axle is called Heaven, where sits the Throne of the Sun.</p>
<p>The innermost ring is called the <strong>Ring of Earth</strong>, which most closely resembles our own world. At the
  boundary of Heaven and Earth are the icy Walls of Heaven, which shield the Earth from the overpowering, fiery radiance
  of the Sun. Capping the Walls along one half is the Infinite Fortress of the Moon, which guards the path to heaven and
  blocks the Sun's light at night, allowing the Wheel's inhabitants a time of rest. Nearly all of the Ring of Earth
  belongs to one great landmass, and sea travel is limited by brutal storms and malevolent sea serpents. At the southern
  end of the world are the Ephemeral Wastes, an enormous, scorching desert which is dotted with the Ring of Earth's
  largest gateways to the Ring of Seasons.</p>
<p>The <strong>Ring of Seasons</strong> is a place of floating, shifting islands inhabited by alien creatures, most
  serving one of four Seasonal Courts. Its turning relative to Earth measures out the year.</p>
<p>The outermost ring is called the <strong>Ring of Stars</strong>, where mind, soul, and body are undivided. Its
  turning measures out the ages, and there Heaven stations its most trusted champions against the Void, the Celestials.
</p>
<h4>Human and Other Cultures</h4>
<p>There are five human supercultures in the Wheel of Creation. <strong>Talbarans</strong> are primarily nomads which
  inhabit the coast and great steppe in the Ring of Earth's west. <strong>Pravyans</strong> survive as farmers and
  hunters in the frozen forests of the northeast. <strong>Riyulans</strong> dwell in the mountainous region in the
  south, divided into a expansive plateau and an isolated jungle. Near the Ring of Earth's center are the <strong>Tizbekians</strong>,
  whose city-states and pastures span an enormous desert. In the hilly grasslands to the southeast is the
  <strong>Azadan</strong> Empire, which controls the only land route to the Wastes. Formerly, the Lei Empire occupied
  the southwest, but now there are only haunted ruins.</p>
<p><strong>Elves</strong> are a people displaced, formerly psionic warriors from the Ring of Stars. Their forms are
  naturally malleable, and they have quickly adapted to life in the Ring of Seasons and Ring of Earth.
  <strong>Dwarves</strong> are beings blessed by and in service to the elements, who dwell throughout Earth. <strong>Blins</strong>,
  including goblins and gnomes, are outcasts of the Courts of the Ring of Seasons. <strong>Scaleborn</strong>, including
  naga and dragonborn, are the descendants of the Scaled Gods, who were first to rule over the Earth.
  <strong>Velniki</strong> are giants renowned for their strength and unwavering faith in the Steward, dwelling in the
  mountains between Talbara and Prav.</p>
<h4>Monsters</h4>
<p><strong>Fey</strong> are creatures from the Ring of Seasons, many of which serve the Courts of Spring, Summer,
  Autumn, and Winter. Each has supernatural abilities and alien desires. <strong>Kostlyavtsi</strong> are intelligent
  undead humans wielding foul sorceries and collectively working towards some unknown purpose. </p>
<p><strong>Tuguai</strong> are decaying constructs of terra cotta and stone, animated by clockwork and magic and built
  to hunt spellcasters. <strong>Daevas</strong> are manifestations of evil which drive mortals to destruction, feeding
  on their anger, sorrow, hatred, and, ultimately, their souls. <strong>Skaryid</strong> are inhabitants of the Ring of
  Stars whose minds are their bodies, corrupted by the Void.</p>
