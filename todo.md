#### Todo

* ~~Update Stablock.from_markdown() to create a new class first instead of building from dictionary~~
* Add to_json() and flatten_json() methods for statblock? 
* Update applying tags to modify a copy of class instead of writing and reading with from_markdown()
* Add some tests
    * Might be useful to have a method that determines which attributes in one Statblock object
    are different from another
* Include applied tags in statblock
* Split parser/website code into separate dirs
* Write a real README/License
* Add OGL info from WotC
* Get web code actually working
* Write tags!
* Tags should support method of fly speed (hover, wings, etc.)??
* Add burrow speed
* Need to infer skills/ability score to use in actions?
* Handle damage for melee/spell/ranged attacks
* Handle spells
